## Thought Process

### Current Focus: Creating a Daily Itinerary for the Golden Triangle

**Reasoning**: Despite the inability to extract content directly from the web pages, I can proceed by leveraging general knowledge about the Golden Triangle's key attractions and typical tourist activities. This will allow me to draft a preliminary daily itinerary for Delhi, Agra, and Jaipur, which can later be refined with more specific details if needed.

**Information Needed**:
- Typical tourist attractions and activities in Delhi, Agra, and Jaipur.
- Recommended time allocation for each attraction.
- Travel logistics between the cities.

**Plan**:
1. **Delhi Itinerary**: Focus on historical and cultural sites such as the Red Fort, India Gate, Qutub Minar, and Humayun's Tomb.
2. **Agra Itinerary**: Highlight the Taj Mahal, Agra Fort, and Fatehpur Sikri.
3. **Jaipur Itinerary**: Include the Amber Fort, City Palace, Hawa Mahal, and Jantar Mantar.
4. **Travel Logistics**: Plan the travel between these cities, considering the most efficient routes and modes of transportation.

### Next Steps:
- Use general knowledge to outline a day-by-day itinerary for each city.
- Consider typical travel times and logistics between the cities to ensure a smooth transition.

I will now proceed to draft a preliminary daily itinerary for the Golden Triangle based on this structure.
