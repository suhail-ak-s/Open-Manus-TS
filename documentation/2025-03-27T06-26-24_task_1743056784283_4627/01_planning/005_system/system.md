Also, — they could have offered a bit more water throughout flight and meals not the greatest. That said, certainly 200 percent better than a very recent AK Air International flight in similar cabin class in comfort and meals. It's a domestic flight, but still the JAL quality shone through. The crew were polite and helpful and even prepared little gifts / souvenirs for the children on the flight, and everyone got a simple drink. The free wifi for entertainment on the personal device was also a great boon, and the shows surprisingly decent. Would recommend. We ordered for non vegetarian Hindu meal but instead they served us vegetarian Hindu meal. That was also not good. It was very annoying and aggravating. Hope our return from Tokyo to jfk on March 27 same is not repeated. Caterar should understand difference between non vegetarian Hindu meal and vegetarian Hindu meal. Allow gold card holders (Group 1) to board with their guest like other One World carriers do Checked baggage process is confusing and time consuming especially when checking oversized bags. Very slow agents didn't help. Food was great, Entertainment was bad, movies were not current and just did not have good variety. Granted I was tired so cranky might have played into my evaluation. Overall based on cost I definitely would fly them again. I am a million mile flyer on another airline, the service on JAL really beats all airlines. The team members are extremely attentive to make sure you have the best experience. Was in premium economy. It is slightly better than economy, but the way the seat reclines actually makes it harder to sit (the seat slides forward and the foot rest comes up - you can lie fairly well reclined but you’ll have to sit cross legged because there is no place for your legs to stretch out. Food is basic economy. Service was great. All in all good, but may make more sense to pay more for business or save a bit and just sit in economy. Seats in \"Premium Economy\" were noticeably more comfortable than those in \"Economy\" and worth the price. My only reservation is that the foot rest did not go higher up. If it did, it would have made the seat much more comfortable. This was the best airline I’ve ever taken. The staff are amazing. The food was great. The pilot was phenomenal. I would highly recommend this airline. There wasn't much entertainment for my short flight but the onboarding process was smooth and the crew provided wonderful service. The seats were also reasonably comfy. Great flight. I had to get rerouted because the weather delayed my flight enough to miss both of my connecting flights. I select nearly 2 hours on customer service trying to get rerouted and had to miss my first plane which took my luggage to San Francisco. Luckily, customer service sent me to the same airport but I had to ride 12 hours in economy after I paid extra for premium economy. Totally sucks that I overpaid. Customer service and airplane crew were great and really helpful though. Although I still hate how small the seat was, especially since I'm smaller than average, I can't imagine how much it would suck for an average sized person. Cabin crew were excellent in taking care of my mom as she boarded the aircraft from her wheelchair. Did not care much for the food served. I stopped flying with United back in the nineties. Today's experience reminded me of why. Great airline all together - triple 7 for a short flight was a plus - lots of room Wonderfully pleasant experience. Good meal and beverage selections. Professional air staff. Seat width can be a bit wider. not nice that they charge extra for the window seats. online check in can be greatly improved. in other words, their online interface is bad. Seat width can be a bit wider. not nice that they charge extra for the window seats. Seats were comfortable with excellent legroom. Meals were also quite good. The cabin crew were excellent and very helpful. The check-in experience was also very smooth. Most relaxing long distance flight I have been on. And I have flown on many. Not great, will likely try to fly another or maybe I should have upgraded my ticket? Needed Air… I don’t think I’ll be flying them again. Tight seats, no flowing air or air nozzles that you can turn air on you, for those who could have motion sickness this would be your worst nightmare. The pilot was great and experienced (which is what you want when flying 12 hours) overall I’m thankful knowledgeable pilots! My ticket did not indication which group I was in for boarding; the gate attended help me Very routh cabin crew food is only 2 meals for 13 hours fry with them They should get better training how to service good super routh language and talking with customer staff are super nice and effiecient! It was a very comfortable and relaxing flight Boarding could have been a little bit better but other than that it was a pretty good experience. I think because of the stowaway to Paris France recently they are being extra diligent about boarding passes at the gate. But they boarded the back of the plane first, and that's something I really think needs to start in the USA. I was ordered vegetarian food, but didn't services to one was a repeat of the meal I had had on the flight immediately preceding this one, which was bad enough I didn't even try it. Drinks were very limited. All I wanted was water, and on a 10.5 hour flight, I was given 3 cups of about 3 ounces each. The seats felt very small. We were supplied with pillows and blankets, which was nice. Lots of noise from the bathroom, plus exterior noise. Made it hard to hear the entertainment system, even using my own noise-cancelling headphones. The food was really bad. I generally request a vegetarian meal and one was supplied, but the pasta was cold and hard and there was nothing pleasant about it. Drinks were very limited. All I wanted was water, and on a 4 hour flight, I was given 2 cups of about 3 ounces each. Everything was perfect. A flight attendant even brought me snacks after I declined food due to my desire to force myself to follow the destination time zone. For the most part, it was an enjoyable experience. It's the 2nd half of the journey was a bit uncomfortable. It was on a noticable smaller plane compared to the previous one. Only process that my luggage didn’t make it to my destination because of short connection but I understand The boarding process was good. The toilet could be better maintained. This has been the worst experience I've ever had. We arrived to Ho Chi Minh Airport and were supposed to get our Asiana ticket from the transfer counter as we came with a different airline. However, the staff at the transfer counter were not helpful and kept giving us different information. We were first told by Asiana airlines staff we had to wait 2 hours so they could print out and give us our tickets, then someone else told us we had to wait 3hrs, someone told us \"I don't know, just go sit and wait and we will tell you later.\" This was at a place in the Ho Chi Minh airport that had no coffee or food shops, nothing, just immigration (to enter Vietnam with a Vietnam Visa) and security (to transfer into the gates) but we needed our printed boarding pass to go through. It wasn't until we demanded to speak to a supervisor as our flight time was 1hr away because they kept telling us \"there's alot of time left for your international flight, we will get your tickets later\" we still had to wait around 20minutes for the \"Supervisor\" to give us our tickets. I would NOT recommend Asiana Airlines, especially if going thru Ho Chi Minh Airport as they are not helpful. (We almost missed our flight, due to their lazyness and incompetence of printing our tickets) I would suggest Asiana Airlines to have a Machine in the transfer area so passengers can easily print out their boarding passes themselves and save some money by not hiring incompetent staff that can't do a simple task such as printing a boarding pass. Great service. They could offer vegetarian food and do more to reduce waste. I like the food, the crew and everything.!!! Except for the delay in our flight. Great service and comfortable seats. The first meal was excellent but the second meal was only satisfactory Everything went smoothly. I appreciate the selection of free movies. I like the friendliness of the crew members. I think the snack could’ve been better instead of a small package of pretzel. I like that they offer me something to drink. The TSA agents in Phoenix were incredibly rude and confiscated belongings that we wanted to check. The flight got changed without our knowledge to a worse situation. The whole thing was terrible Air Canada was great! From the airport at Montreal to boarding to the food on board the plane. The crew was great too! There was a slight issue with some other peoples’ tickets that I overheard about but the crew handled with care immediately to ensure everyone was comfortable and we could takeoff! Great experience with Air Canada My experience with Air Canada was good. Great customer service… only a few delays and issues with the tunnel to exit the plain. I did not appreciate that we arrived at terminal D and had to go to terminal E to get the bags/ luggage. PDX staff was great and we arrived on time in YVR. They announced before boarding that the flight was full and there would be limited space in the overhead bins and you could check in for free. We did and after we boarded the plane found it was not full and there was plenty of space in the overhead bins. I’m not sure why they made this announcement. Front desk attendant wouldn’t check me in even though there was not a single person in line. Made me use the kiosk. Kiosk had an error (of course) no baggage can be checked at this kiosk please see attendant. Then I had to wait in line for the same front desk attendant waiting for 5 people who ended up coming in front of me while I tried to use a broken and useless kiosk. Finally after checked in, wait 30 min to board all the way to zone 6 and they would deny me even after all the zone 1-5 people already went. Just literally making us wait to board so they stand there doing nothing for 5 minutes. Just ridiculous and awful customer service. Fly with literally anyone else They are a great airline, and i enjoying flying with them. However my experience with booking through Kayak was a horrible experience. With all the restrictions and glitches of website. My entire bookings by kayak was wrong. And there was no possible way of fixing anything with them, because they hand over responsibility to the airline after purchase is made. Will not be booking through Kayak again and will inform my family and friends not to as well. All was good with comfort and ease of boarding. There was confusion from what gate to board at. Meant moving a long distance but I allowed plenty of time for this. Not what you’re looking for? Find thousands of other hotels, flights, car rentals and package deals with KAYAK.
