  "feedback": "The execution of the step to search for flights from Seattle to Japan for the specified dates and budget did not yield specific flight options or pricing details. The result was a general description of the plan rather than actionable flight information. This is inadequate for moving forward with the itinerary planning, as specific flight details are crucial for scheduling and budgeting the trip."
