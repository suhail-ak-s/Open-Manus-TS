Staff had no problems arrange to hold on to my backpack although the room wasn't booked in my name. Later when the whole family arrived (with old folks rather than older children!), the check-in process was painless. There was an extremely friendly receptionist (looked to be Belgian?) who laid out the red carpet and answered our Q's patiently.\nRooms were spotless. The hotel has a dedicated smoking room. But no parking lots!\nThis is one of the best places I have stayed in Japan, it is so well thought out, aesthetically pleasing, location is phenomenal as it is right next to the bus station and minutes walk from a japanese garden.  I would not hesitate to stay there again.\nI've stayed at other 5 star hotels in Japan and I'd say Daiwa royal hotel is up there with them - but at a fraction of the price.\n\nRooms are huge, extremely super clean, very comfy bed, had great water pressure, large bathroom, had great extras like in room coffee machine and a guest mobile phone with mobile data. 2 minutes from kyoto station next to a super large barg...\nI've stayed at other 5 star hotels in Japan and I'd say Daiwa royal hotel is up there with them - but at a fraction of the price.\n\nRooms are huge, extremely super clean, very comfy bed, had great water pressure, large bathroom, had great extras like in room coffee machine and a guest mobile phone with mobile data. 2 minutes from kyoto station next to a super large bargain department store and food. Absolutely no complaints apart from being surprised with a  small \"hotel tax\" at check-in.\n\nThe best thing were the slippers. Probably the best hotel slipper's I've ever received.\none of cheapest hotel in Hakata but much more satisfaction than expected. The hotel is quite modern and not so long to be built.

The Japanese bathe was fun and interesting. The hotel is only a few steps from two main train stations. Tons of restaurants and shopping close by. Only three stops to ginza and uneo Park taking the train. Was not a crowded area and there was a 711 right next to the hotel for all your snacking needs. Cute little restaurant on the first floor of the building. Concierge was very helpful with getting to know the city and helped with taxis/excursions. Will definitively stay again. Small rooms, but most hotels in japan are small. Can’t wair to come back.\nThe hotel is surrounded by beautiful natural scene. I went there on New year's holiday and it snowed all around, which was beautiful.

Though the location was far from the convenient city (because you are surround by the nature) but the bus stop's right at the front of the hotel and there's got everything you need. \nThey offered sleds to play around the hotel. It's close to the ski area as well.\nThe staffs are very helpful and so nice. (Some of them can speak English fluently. Others who can't were always eager to help out, which was very great.)\nNew hotel so the place is really nice and new.  Walking distance to Dotonburi and convenience stores, food was never an issue. It's a bit of walking from station though. Room space is big compared to other hotels in Japan. There's regular shuttle service provided by hotel. to the nearest train station.\nHotel has its own parking but chargeable at 1000 yen per night (reasonable). We booked at a standard room however the room size is not too small.  The environment of the open onsen is very nice but not big.  Breakfast is recommended. late night ramen is provided from 9:30 to 11:00 pm. Nearby the hotel, just across the street, there are a lot of food selection.\nAside of a tiny room, which is not \"wrong\" in general in terms of the hotels in Japan, nothing really came bad.

They do provide welcome drink and snacks for free during certain times, so you may relax at the 1st floor before rushing into the room. It is 1 minute away from the subway station and literally located just in front of the entrance of Nakasu red-light area. There are tons of good restaurants and convenience stores just around corners and in general, this hotel does not cost you that much. My 2 visits have been fantastic with this hotel. Highly recommended.\nalmost everything about the stay was superb. location is amazing, right next to the entrance to Universal Studios.

Subway station is also just next door. sufficient choices of restaurants / foods in the plaza just in front. also, there is a Lawson convenience store right at the lobby level of the hotel. i love the minimalism design of the room, which i think is very neat and efficient. the only downside about the room is that they do not have any king-size bed in the whole hotel, not so couple-friendly. but i guess this is the common practice in many hotels in Japan.\r\n\r\nalso, we needed to hire a van taxi to go to the airport. i had to go three times to the concierge, assisted by the same lady. on the first two requests, we only said the estimate price but said that the service was full on my day of departure. only after i tried again for the third time, talking to the same person, sharing my urgency why i really need the service, that she went ahead to try calling several taxi companies she has already had on her file since the very beginning. she managed to get me the van booked only after her second try. it was helpful, but definitely would have been a lot more helpful if she can just do it right the first time.\nnot very close to shopping area but hotel is good and new\nsame as other japan hotel , it is very small but it is good\nCan tell it's a new hotel with its cleanness and modern design.

And there are lots of restaurant and convenience stores around. \n\n Only to complain is no carpark for guests, have to park at nearby car park with 2000 yen per day, which she unexpected. Overall it's worth to stay in this hotel and highly recommended.\nLocation hotel very convenient, to Nippombashi subway walk about 5 mins to hotel and Namba station takes about 10 mins.

The bed is big, like the onsen as I go in the early morning which no crowd , enjoying the pool and relaxing for the indoor and outdoor onsen.  Breakfast is great too, like their bread station and is fresh made by their own.\nThe unit is very new. The location is good. Surround by 24 hours convenience stores & supermarket.

Is the white side of Japan and we truest enjoy our stay here after the bustling busy sight seeing and shopping at day time. Staff are Super helpful too. \n\nBad\nNothing to complaint. The walk to station was manageable. But accordingly some is a bit far. The only limitation is house keeping is done on every fourth day. On demand cleaning is at ¥2,0000\nI had an excellent couple of nights at The Pocket Hotel. Location is excellent (although a bit of a walk from Kyoto Station), rooms and facilities are pristine clean, and the privacy and soundproofing is very nice.

If you’re looking for a good night’s sleep I’m the heart of Kyoto without paying an arm and a leg, definitely consider this place.\nVery conveniently located as a base to explore  Kyoto. Walking distance to Nishiki Market and Arashiyama, Kinkakuji-ji and Nijo-jo are a short journey away. Only 2 stops to Kyoto Station that we used to travel to and from Tokyo and Hiroshima.

Walking distance to Nishiki Market and Arashiyama, Kinkakuji-ji and Nijo-jo are a short journey away. Only 2 stops to Kyoto Station that we used to travel to and from Tokyo and Hiroshima. The breakfast was one of the best of the hotels we stayed in during our trip to Tokyo and the croissants possibly the best I’ve ever had. I would recommend paying the extra for the premium rooms as these were much larger than you normally find in Japan and had a few extras like a daily drink coupon, better in room complimentary drinks and snack. It was also useful to have the toilet and sink/shower in separate rooms.\nThe room is quite big compared to most of japan hotels, the staff is very helpful and the location is the hotel is perfect. It's 5 mins walk to Ginza station and ginza main shopping area.\nGot a single, smoking room. Very nice room no complaints. My first time in Japan and this business hotel is located near a major train station, Nippori Station. Very convenient to travel to just about anywhere in Tokyo and to and from Narita Airport.

My first time in Japan and this business hotel is located near a major train station, Nippori Station. Very convenient to travel to just about anywhere in Tokyo and to and from Narita Airport. Might be confusing at first to use their train and metro but then I have my best friend with me which is Google Maps and Japan Travel apps and it made my solo trip seamless when it comes to trasportation.  Lot’s of restaurants nearby, convenient stores and drugstores that sells almost anything you might need. Yanaka Ginza, a quaint landmark in Tokyo is very near, about 15 mins walk from the hotel which I explored on the last day of my trip. I would not hesitate to recommend this hotel because of its customer service and convenience, though as you have read in other reviews that the rooms are small, and it is, might need a lot of manuevering around for 2 people but over all it was good experience for me. Yes!! Just book this hotel 😀😀\nThe hotel is just a 3 mins walk from the nearest metro , Shinjuku Gyoenmae.  Alternatively, you could take a 5 mins walk to Shinjuku Sanchome (if it works better with your route!).\n\nJust to be clear, hotels in Japan are VERY SMALL, so this hotel is absolutely normal and reasonable for the rate you're paying for. \n\nThe rooms are extremely well cleaned/kept, and the toil...\nThe hotel is just a 3 mins walk from the nearest metro , Shinjuku Gyoenmae.

Each room also comes with a fridge.\n\nThe hotel also offers coin laundry/dryer services (I think this is quite common across hotels in Japan), so that was very convenient for me.\n\nWould definitely recommend this hotel especially to solo travelers (presuming the smaller room space isn't an issue to you)!\ni've been living in japan for more than 9 years, and been to many hotels throughout japan. from the 3stars hotel to the 5stars. small, poor interior design, and overpriced was my impression about hotels in japan. but i was so pleasantly surprised when i with hundred stay. wirh almost ridiculously minimal price (if you book through agoda), i got all i could expect from ...\ni've been living in japan for more than 9 years, and been to many hotels throughout japan. from the 3stars hotel to the 5stars. small, poor interior design, and overpriced was my impression about hotels in japan. but i was so pleasantly surprised when i with hundred stay. wirh almost ridiculously minimal price (if you book through agoda), i got all i could expect from a luxury hotel, and more. \r\nthe room was unbelievably spacey, especially for japan standard. interior design was excellent. complete facility and room amenity. will definitely definitely come back again, and again.\nThis is the best experience I've ever had regardless of price.

I've stayed at hotels all over Asia and little in Europe half the price and 3x the price.\n\nI've arrived at the above opinion 1 day into my 3 day stay, it was THAT good and it only got better even after I checked-out!\n\nUpon arrive we were notified the grade of our room was full and was upgraded without hesitation.  I'm constantly surprised how many hotel try to hesitate on this obviously only thing to do.\n\nThe term \"Hotel\" in Japan means a different thing than in the West, and I can assure you no matter where you come from this hotel will not be considered \"small\" like others in Japan.  This is a proper Western sized hotel.\n\nWe got a huge room with a large queen bed with wall to wall floor to ceiling window view of the whole Shinjuku district, to get a better view you probably have to go to the Shinjuku Gov building's observation floor.\n\nI could go into infinity details, but I will just say, the Japanese are really into details.  In a totally anal sense, and the room was prepared and equipped to the best of their abilities.  There are things and service in the room that you wouldn't think of needing, because they've thought about everything.  \n\nFor those of you backpackers who think you just need a room, you need to find something 1/2 of this price or else you are not getting good value.  For those traveling with family like me, we need service!  Like letting our 8yr old stay in the room without extra charge.  Having a convenience store in the hotel.  Airport shuttle at the lobby.  Bath products that will make all the ladies scream.  Close but not in the middle of it all in Shinjuku so we can have a relaxing stay, but also a covered conveyor belt walk way into the metro station, that make a huge difference during the rain!\n\nThe whole service got even better after we checked out.  I accidently left 2 expensive polo shirts and worse of all a stack of cash and only set of car keys in the room.  I didn't rea\nI've been there with my husband just 3mins walk from nankai line station which we could use this line to airport.

From here we could take subway to osaka castle, universal studio japan, kaiyukan aquarium and walked to Den Den town for gundum store...if we have a chance to visit osaka, we will go to namba and stay at namba oriental for sure.\nGem of a hotel in crazy Shinjuku. Very modern and clean with super cool rooftop bar from which to chill and watch sun go down over Shinjuku. Like most of Japan, hotel rooms are small so get the biggest you can afford, it’s worth it.

We are totally recommending our friends to stay and will stay again if we visit Osaka again.\nExcellent hotel in the heart of Higashiyama!

I have stayed in this hotel a few years ago and it continues to hold very fond memories. The staff are all so very helpful, respectful and friendly with none of our requests being ever too big or too small. This time round, I had booked a smoking room during our online booking with Agoda as this was the only availability offered. I emailed them to request if they were able to sanitise our room thoroughly as we have 2 young children (aged 3 & 4). They had placed us in a non smoking floor and room. Above and beyond :) Thank you Hotel Granvia, you've been a highlight!\nLove to stay here. Staffs are helpful, on 18th October,  my father spectacle was broken.

Out of this 3 , i enjoyed my stay the most in Hotel NIkko. Location was fantastic. Great for those into shopping since you are staying just opposite dotonbori. near to the station as well.

The area was a little far from the main city centre - Karuizawa, but it was fine because we wanted a less crowded place to stay over. Naka-Karuizawa is a quiet neighbourhood but its proximity to the Stone Church and Harunire Terrace was good enough. The accommodation place has a superb place for dinner - wagyu beef set was heavenly! Great haven to stay if you like to be in a little quiet town away from the buzz of tourists!\nDear Mass, we are very happy with the room, it is beautiful, well decorated, clean and well equipped.

My family is very happy staying there and keep appraising the place. You can conveniently wash dan dry your clothes using a coin machines downstairs in the next building. The host's reply is prompt. There are other so much good things to tell here, in short, it is very much recommended. Thank you Masa.\nThe staff are so accommodating. \nYou don't need to check out everyday which is different from a usual capsule hotel in Japan. \nNo lockers for your stuff but there's a common area where you can put it. \nNo towels, you need to pay extra for renting. \nLounge is beautiful!\nBathrooms are private, not common bathing area. \nSmoking area is at the lobby.\n-The hostel is cheap compared to others.\n-Location is near to the town, it takes about 10 minutes to walk to nakasukawabata station and to tenjin.\n-The hostel is clean, however the toilets can be very wet after other tourists use it.

We chilled outside the hostel and met some foreign friends too. The free breakfast was rice and seaweed soup, I really like it. \nThey also have washing machine and a dryer, the dryer was kinda useless because our clothes didnt dry completely so we ended up dry them in our bed space.\n\nOverall was okay, its my first time in Japan and I'd definitely stay here again one day\nGreat hotel and very close (actually connected to) the train station including the Shinkansen bullet train.

However, if you plan to come and check-in early they allow check-in at 4pm-11pm. Or you can just leave your luggage in their common area and come back at 4pm to check-in. There are a lot of things you can do in their common area, make your own coffee, eat free breakfast (8:30am-11:00am), play some board and card games, play instruments, and make friends with other guests! Lastly, their area is very close to Teradacho so it’s easy to go to different locations. There’s also a temple and park near their area. Special thanks to Etsu, Eito and Fuya who have been a great help to us during our stay!\nI will definetly book again in your hostel when i go back to Japan. This hostel offer a warm hospitality that you may feel a home away from home. Good job Qoo Hostel Ebisucho!!!\nAround 5-10 minutes from kyoto station, so far best hotel in Japan i ever stayed.

Very friendly and helpful staff, big space room compared to other hotel in tokyo with same value money. I lost the phone and they really helpful to help me find it. Near family mart and some japan restaurants. Definitely will back!\nIt was hard for us to find the hotel as our GPS doesn't have any information about this hotel, with the Japanese people's help, we finally found our hotel. The hotel was nice, all the little details in the room were great. Just it would be better if we have our own bathroom.\nBest things that could come out of this budget. Thanks !\nI stayed in a dormitory for 4 nights. The dormitory itself is great, you get a cubicle with a bed, a little security box, an outlet, and some space to put your stuff.

The dormitory itself is great, you get a cubicle with a bed, a little security box, an outlet, and some space to put your stuff. The room is air conditioned at night, and the bed is comfy enough to not have any problems sleeping.\n\nAlthough, the room itself is quite small, and thus the beds are quite short, best suited for someone under 180 cm (otherwise your feet would stick out from your cubicle.) The hallway lights in the room is always on, so you won't get a pitch black environment to sleep in (but the curtains are probably adequate in blocking the light for most.) And like most dormitories, you won't get much audio privacy.\n\nThe toilets are small and slightly dirty. The showers, however are great. There are amenities provided, although there is no place to dry your towel, so that might become a problem.\n\nThe location is not hard to get to, but it doesn't stand out, so you might just not notice it. But it is away from the main road, away from the traffic and noises in the night, great for a quiet place to rest.\nLocation is a little bit hard to find and a bit far from the station But everything was nice.\r\nit was really clean, and their staffs were so kind.\r\nI joined their okonomiyaki party. And it was good to see other travelers in japan.\r\nAlso They lent a bicycle at the hostel so could look around the city well.\r\nI think its good to stay for short trip;)\nI left my bag when I checked-out and just realized abt it when I was in-flight to back home.

The hotel staff kindly confirmed that my bag is in the hotel and gratefully, they are able to keep it until I found the solution how to get back my bag bcs the things inside are so important. Then hotel staff helped me to communicate with someone from same country as me who is staying at the hotel to help bring my bag back. And Thank God, I do believe there are still many good people exits in this world, and the one who I contact to, have no issue to bring my bag back. Thanks Riza san and all hotel staffs, and Thanks to Bu Sisilia to help me out. \n\nThis hotel has really good location. Close to Nippori station and has a great cleanliness. They also provide drink machine in the lobby so that you don’t need yo buy water for your travel (if you bring your own tumbler ). 😬\n\nI am considering to be back to this hotel when I am visiting Japan again someday.\nSachi is my favorite guesthouse in Japan I have been there twice and I have plans to go back for a third time. \nIs not only cheap, but the accommodations are great, either if you book a private room or a bunk bed, and the staff are as friendly as it gets.\nI actually didn't wanted to leave Sachi today because I felt I had everything I needed.

A comfortable bed, a hot shower, a high speed wifi connection, a fully equipped kitchen with space to store my food and many nice people always going and coming to the house. Maybe that's the selling point, its actually a very peaceful place! I could focus on my studies and improved my kanji a lot. But don't be fooled, the party is around the corner (almost literally) and in Shinsekai there is always something to do. \nElse you can go to the nearby Namba area or wherever you want since there are multiple transportation options close by. I even got to Ise for a day trip but just walking around the streets of Tennoji and the geeki Den Den Town can be very fun. \n\n\nEven if you decide just to stay at the house is a great plan, the atmosphere is relaxed and there is always someone to talk with. On days I just wanted to rest I meet so many good people in Sachi. Both foreigners and Japanese, short and long term residents live in harmony and are willing to share. You might even be able to participate on the fun parties organized by the staff and the residents. \nFinally, I want to thank all the nice and attentive members of the staff with which I spent the most time with and to the manager who is a very caring and considerate person, a cool pianist and super good cook. \nI cannot wait to go back to Sachi on Spring!\nGood location, only 5 mins from Nankai(train for Kansai airport) Osaka metro, JR. \nThe building is old but you can tell they do the best to keep it clean with this low price.\nReception open hour is limited, but didn't cause inconvince to me, and the staffs were so nice and welling to help. \nThe bath is shared(separate man and female by time), means you may be naked wit...\nGood location, only 5 mins from Nankai(train for Kansai airport) Osaka metro, JR. \nThe building is old but you can tell they do the best to keep it clean with this low price.\nReception open hour is limited, but didn't cause inconvince to me, and the staffs were so nice and welling to help. \nThe bath is shared(separate man and female by time), means you may be naked with other people around. No need to feel shy since you're enjoying the very Japanese traditional style living.\n\nThe wall is thin so you can hear other people if they speak loudly. So of you stay here please also consider about others, keep quite when it is late, and I believe you will have a good experience of staying! :)\nI stayed in this guesthouse two nights. I had a really nice experience here, overall. The staff were warm and welcoming and the whole guesthouse had the same atmosphere.

I had a really nice experience here, overall. The staff were warm and welcoming and the whole guesthouse had the same atmosphere. It’s the kind of place you can sit down in the common area and have a conversation with anyone around. \nWith that said, there were two things I think are worth mentioning that did not spoil my experience but maybe could be approved upon. The first was the overall temperature of the guesthouse. It was freezing, especially at night. My top bunk was next to the window and I’m sure there’s no insulation there because the cold comes right through. \nSecondly, the smell of my particular room was the essence of a high school boy’s locker room. I walked into other rooms to see if it carried the same stench and they did not. Therefore it was the specific guys that were in my room. However, I think the guesthouse could do to post signs that explain and encourage how to keep a sanitary environment (as I have seen is customary in japan). For instance, one of the cupboards used to store baggage was filled with one guy’s clothes (both clean and dirty I presume from the smell). This could be helped with more attention to upkeep, I believe. \nStill I appreciated my experience with this guesthouse.\nI booked a room with 6 beds (3 bunk beds) for 6 people, and I would say that I really enjoyed to stay here. The room is quite big (for Osaka or Japan), and quite cheap. It's famous for backpackers or young people. The room is clean, and there is a bathroom inside the room only for SHOWER.

The room is quite big (for Osaka or Japan), and quite cheap. It's famous for backpackers or young people. The room is clean, and there is a bathroom inside the room only for SHOWER. If you want to use toilet then there is a shared toilet in each floor, which is CLEAN! But, they separate the toilet for women and men, so for example in my floor, the toilet is for men only, so for women, they have to go upstair or downstair (using lift or just on foot). I would say the location is the strongest selling point of this hotel. It's located in the heart of Namba area, it's near Namba station (I would say the exit nomor 30 is the best, because there is an elevator there, and it is inside the OCAT building. The intercity bus also in the OCAT building, so for those who want to use the intercity bus, you just need to walk less than 300 meter from the hotel!). There are many restaurants near the hotel, like Sukiya (cheap food), and also near Dotonbori. It's a good hotel in the prime location!.\nIf you are looking for a home away from home, I would recommend for you to stay at Deer Guesthouse. The owner is super nice.

The owner is super nice. Even after I checked out, he let me leave my luggage (for FREE) so that I can still visit the Horyuji Temple. When I got back at around 3pm I was sp tired because the weather was so hot, before going out to grab his lunch, he told me that I can rest inside the guesthouse and leave once I feel refreshed/recharged. Compared to other hostels, Deer guesthouse is really hospitable. Others will not allow guests to leave their luggage after check out. Oh, and I slept comfortably here even though this is the simplest hostel I've booked in Japan. Also, the location is super okey. It is near to all the tourists spots in Nara and to train stations as well.\nThe Hotel / Hostel mix was a very pleasant hotel to stay in, with good vibes. Room was decently big for Japan standards and there was even a mini TV inside (though I didnt really use it).\n\nShared facilities like toilets and shower rooms were clean.

For ladies, you can use both the unisex and female only showers. Do note it's only on the first floor though.\n\nStaff was friendly with passable English and was able to give me recommendations on where to go and places of interest, some being really helpful because they were Festivals which dont really appear on travel sites and more of a local thing.\n\nLocation is walking distance to both the Metro and JR lines, so you could get to anywhere in Osaka (or other parts of Japan if you really needed to) quite easily.  \n2 Family Marts nearby, if you wanted some late night snacks or get some essentials.\n\nMinor Gripe :\nI think the room was ready before the 3pm check-in but they just wouldn't let me have the room until then.\nIt was my first time traveling alone and I was hesitant to book a bed in a dorm room.

Check-in is at the restaurant next to the hostel and the owner is quite nice. The bed I received was bigger than I expected and it was that it came with it's own little door to separate it from the rest of the room. The only compliant I had was with the other travelers but of course, the hostel can't help with that. I would probably stay here again. (also the Pokemon Center is near and it's a must visit)\nBest hostel per budget so far I’ve been to in Japan. You get fridges to store food, kitchen to cook, coin laundry and locker to store small valuables. Downstairs is a cafe where you can eat all day, Nepali chicken curry is very good. Note that you make your own bed.\n\nFor access, take Keihan train to Kiyomizu-Gojo station and walk here, or JR train to Kyoto station and ...\nBest hostel per budget so far I’ve been to in Japan.

Note that you make your own bed.\n\nFor access, take Keihan train to Kiyomizu-Gojo station and walk here, or JR train to Kyoto station and take the bus 86, 100 202, 207 to Gojozaka bus stop.\n\nThe hostel is near Gion area and the entrance pathway to Kiyomizu temple. Other attractions are easily reached by bus and I suggest buying 600 yen one day bus pass from the hostel staff if you will ride the bus at least three times in one day, except for Fushimi Inari which is much easier to get to by train.\n\nFor food, head left towards Gion direction for about 300 metres, there’s a 24 hr Fresco supermarket which sells much cheaper stuff than convenient stores.\nI don't know why, but a lot of the other reviews I saw made this hotel seem like a decrepit hellpit in the middle of a road warrior-esque wasteland.

There's even a youtube video proclaiming it ti be the scariest hostel in Japan. It was so cheap I half expected that either we would be brutally sodomized in our sleep, or there would be some kind of locked room murder, and as a crazy foreigner it would be my job to solve it while twirling my fantastic moustache.  Even towards the end of my stay I was wondering if we were about to become the stars of another terrible Paranormal Activity movie.  That said, this placr is fantastic,  no murders no anal rape-age, just a chep, clean hostel thats a two minute walk from the station and a ton of famous tourist areas.  It's all family run so don't expect Jeeves and Mr. Belvedere to double team you with room service.  But for this price expect a good cheap clean room.  The showers are shared (seperated by gender though, ofc) so that might have put some people off, but honestly that's how a lot of the showers are in Japan, and certainly how all the ones in an onsen (sauna) are.   Also the family dogs are on the first floorso if yyou're allergic don't go.  It even has wi-fi on the first floor\nEvery place in japan was very clean. This place reminded me more of European hostel.  The owner is nice and the hostel is decent; just compared to other Japanese hostels, nothing is noteworthy\nIt was my first solo trip and first visit to Japan and I've already missed it!\r\nStaffs are very lovely and helpful!\r\nThe first day I emailed due to unexpected flight delay, they let me delay check in time one hour later.\r\nThere was a morning that I had bad mood (from last night's lost way and stomach problem).\r\nTried to ask a staff about ramen casually with my poor Jap...\nIt was my first solo trip and first visit to Japan and I've already missed it!\r\nStaffs are very lovely and helpful!\r\nThe first day I emailed due to unexpected flight delay, they let me delay check in time one hour later.\r\nThere was a morning that I had bad mood (from last night's lost way and stomach problem).\r\nTried to ask a staff about ramen casually with my poor Japanese, but I might turned out to be rude, she answered patiently and I forgot to say the greetings as when Japanese people going out, even a bye. Yet they still did. I felt bad and heart-warmed at the same time (Thank you, Ichiran ramen was awesome!), couldn't stay long but I imagine you'd have a wonderful day in Osaka just hanging out with them alone.\r\n\r\nAlso they'd silently change your towels like ninja and clean the shower few times a day, so you can't really blame them if still seeing something you don't like.\r\n\r\nIn terms of facilities, it's an open space for many beds in entirely floor (I usually come back very late, so if you see bad reviews about noise around sep. 14-18, that'd prob. be me :/), there are curtains as doors which you can hear people whispering or outside door sounds. I suggest guesthouse could sell ear plugs or bring your own.\r\nI stayed at 2nd floor and there was a long desk with chairs, water heater next to the beds, but you'll have to fill the water at 1st floor which opened until 10 pm.\r\nTho there are many vending machines outside 24hr. or shower water which I drank (shower room is awesome!). There's also a washing/drying machine.\r\n3rd floor has a balcony for smoking area (I didn't go up there so don't really know about it or 1st floor room). The interior is beautiful overall.\r\n\r\nWish the staffs and guesthouse all the best and I'd definitely love to stay there again!\nHi, I would like to thanks every staff who had help me during my trip.

Absolutely no complaints apart from being surprised with a  small \"hotel tax\" at check-in.\n\nThe best thing were the slippers. Probably the best hotel slipper's I've ever received.\nNew hotel so the place is really nice and new.  Walking distance to Dotonburi and convenience stores, food was never an issue.

Subway station is also just next door. sufficient choices of restaurants / foods in the plaza just in front. also, there is a Lawson convenience store right at the lobby level of the hotel. i love the minimalism design of the room, which i think is very neat and efficient. the only downside about the room is that they do not have any king-size bed in the whole hotel, not so couple-friendly. but i guess this is the common practice in many hotels in Japan.\r\n\r\nalso, we needed to hire a van taxi to go to the airport. i had to go three times to the concierge, assisted by the same lady. on the first two requests, we only said the estimate price but said that the service was full on my day of departure. only after i tried again for the third time, talking to the same person, sharing my urgency why i really need the service, that she went ahead to try calling several taxi companies she has already had on her file since the very beginning. she managed to get me the van booked only after her second try. it was helpful, but definitely would have been a lot more helpful if she can just do it right the first time.\nLocation hotel very convenient, to Nippombashi subway walk about 5 mins to hotel and Namba station takes about 10 mins.

I emailed them to request if they were able to sanitise our room thoroughly as we have 2 young children (aged 3 & 4). They had placed us in a non smoking floor and room. Above and beyond :) Thank you Hotel Granvia, you've been a highlight!\nThis is the second time for me. The reason we chose Vessel again is the amazing ocean view and bath house.

Imagine after a day of sightseeing, get a hot bath on the roof top, hooo.. amazing. Comparing other hotels in Japan, the size of the room in Vessel is very good. \n\nRecommend to stay in Chatan area, as it is easy to go north and south. Vessel is close to American Village, and it is easy to get some 24 hours restaurant in that area.\nMe and my wife stayed in a Twin Room for 3 nights. Brand new hotel, with onsen, and complimentary noodles in the evening.\n\nIt is located about 3 minutes' walk to Dotonbori which is full of good restaurants.

Brand new hotel, with onsen, and complimentary noodles in the evening.\n\nIt is located about 3 minutes' walk to Dotonbori which is full of good restaurants. You can then walk right to Shinsaibashi which is just on the west end of Dontonbori. To the south, it is about 5 minutes' walk to Kuromon Market where you can buy really good toro and grilled seafood from stalls, many of which provide seating. Walk further for about 20 minutes is Namba where there are department stores etc. Overall, we liked the location but it can be awkward to get to via metro if you have heavy luggage. We took the Keihan Railway from Kyoto and then took the metro which got us to Nippombashi Station. Then it was a 100 meter walk to the north. However, when we departed, we decided to take the Nankai Railway to Kansai International Airport, and we had to walk with luggage for 20 minutes to Namba Station. We were ok although we would not recommend it if you have a lot of luggage.\n\nThe hotel is brand new and very nicely decorated. Note that you need to place your shoes in lockers before entering into the main areas of the hotel. If it was not for a strain of hair that we found on the floor in our room, we would have given full marks on cleanliness. We had a Moderate Twin Room and the beds, pillows and duvet were really comfortable. Aircon and wifi were great, with coffee and tea making available. Room was on the small side, but there was enough space and we had seen smaller rooms in nicer hotels in Japan so no complaints.\n\nStaff scored top marks from us as they were extremely pro-active and helpful, and spoke very good English. On the first day, we arrived before check-in time, so we deposited our luggage and went out. When we came back in early evening, our luggage was already placed in our room.\n \nWe will definitely come back!\nThe hotel is right in middle of Kokusai Street, and very close to the restaurants and shops located in the area. It is bit far from the Yui Rail station, but still within walkable distance. \n\nMy booking allowed me to check in early, which is a nice option since many hotels in Japan don't give you keys to your room until the actual check-in time.\n\nThe room was spacious ...\nThe hotel is right in middle of Kokusai Street, and very close to the restaurants and shops located in the area.

I was impressed with the soft towels, the ones you get at the more expensive hotels.\nWe emailed this hotel that we would be away from home and celebrating Christmas in Tokyo.

They were kind enough to give us the room with the view of the Tokyo Skytree. The room was decent size even with Japan standards. Our sheets were changed daily,  It made our homesickness better, from missing our family at Christmas. The room was perfect, cleaned daily,it feels so good to sleep after a whole day of shopping and sightseeing,  amenities were top notch, breakfast was great. I would come back again and stay in this hotel if I am in Tokyo. Trains connect you to all the shopping and sightseeing, there is a Supermarket next door in a mall adjacent to the hotel. Housekeeping and desk staff have excellent manner, Japan is a country with hospitable people. Everything is an art, the food presentation, coffee shops, desserts, culinary arts. I will be back again. Thank you , Japan for such a wonderful vacation and this hotel made it special for us.\nI have tried near 10 hotels in Japan so far, Richmond Hotel Premier Tokyo Oshiage just takes over my number one choice, 3-bed room is large and comfortable, all 3 of us can open our luggage easily; huge super market at first floor, convenient store around corner plus free steps away from a large shopping center and various restaurants at Sky Tree.

They helped me work out the local express bus times so that we could go to Churaumi Aquarium and booked a taxi for us to get to the bus stop. Though I speak a little Japanese, many of the staff speak English exceptionally well so I never felt that I couldn't communicate with them.\n\nThe room was really spacious and we had a lovely view of the water and the planes landing at the airport. During the night we had no troubles with noise pollution because the doors and double-sealed. The room was always spotless and the bath was big enough for two.\n\nThe breakfast was really delicious with many kinds of foods and even some Okinawan specialties. The view while eating breakfast was really lovely too because you gaze over the pool to the nearby beach as you sip your coffee. We also had dinner one of the nights from the local Italian restaurant (next to the hotel) and it was really nice. The view was beautiful and you can have your food out looking over the ocean.\n\nMy favourite part of the stay though? The onsen! I have only been to four different onsens in Japan so far but this was the best one I have been to yet. The standing pool was divine! I loved gazing out at the lights in the distance on a balmy night immersed up to the shoulders in the standing pool. It was so relaxing and the water quality is very good, plus the onsen facilities were all spotlessly clean.\n\nThe only thing I would note is that you are on a small island near the airport so if you don't have a hire car you will need to use taxis or the hotel's shuttle service to get to the monorail line (which ends at the airport).\n\nOverall our stay was lovely and really memorable. I highly recommend Ryukyu Onsen Sengajima Hotel if you want to relax in a scenic, comfortable setting and have the use of a great quality onsen with kind and helpful staff.\nStay with Hotel Monterey Le Frere Osaka during our honeymoon.

The receptionist was so helpful, he not only helped us complete the form which is best written in Japanese (and he's got really nice handwriting!), he also called the receiving Tokyo hotel to inform them about my request and confirm their address! He also patiently explained to us about the pricing. As this is our first time trying this luggage delivery arrangement, his help really put us at ease.  His name starts with T (i really regretted not getting his name). We are really grateful for his help and service!\n\nHotel wise, it's clean and in a peaceful neighborhood. The area is easy and nice to walk around. It was drizzling when we were there so the weather was so nice for us to stroll to and from Ginza + hotel. It's also v near Takaracho Subway Station which makes it really convenient\nIf convenient is your first  priority, this APA hotel is superb.\r\nFirst, getting from and to  Narita is a breeze, taking a shuttle bus operated by Heisei directly from the airport to the hotel in mere 45 min without any hassle.\r\nThe hotel itself is large and with all the amenities you may wish to have, it even has 2 Lawson, 24 hours convenient stores in it.\r\nThe room, ...\nIf convenient is your first  priority, this APA hotel is superb.\r\nFirst, getting from and to  Narita is a breeze, taking a shuttle bus operated by Heisei directly from the airport to the hotel in mere 45 min without any hassle.\r\nThe hotel itself is large and with all the amenities you may wish to have, it even has 2 Lawson, 24 hours convenient stores in it.\r\nThe room, since most of the hotel in Japan is on the small size but it is fully equipped and come with a very large screen LED screen TV for you to relax at night. One spectacular thing about the room is its lighting, most of the hotel room I experienced was dark but APA room in contrary is very bright I can read a book happily without having any problem and you can also able to dim it to the level that you feel comfortable and relax.\r\nSurrounding, the reason I chose this place is I want to go to the exhibition at Makuhari Messe without having to walk too far, and it proved to be a right decision, only the New Otani hotel is closer.\nThis hotel is on the pricier side but with our last three days in Japan spent here we weren’t disappointed.\nBreakfast seemed a bit expensive so we ate elsewhere. The beds were good and room size bigger than normal for Japan.\nIf you want to stay in the Roppongi area then this is the best bet.\nStaff were very informative and helpful.\nWe stayed in a cottage on the West side of the hotel and it was a great experience for the whole family.

Though a bit old, the  cottage was lovely, spacious and clean. It was also near ski locker and ski lift, making it convenient for beginners with small kids  like us  to go back and forth to the cottage if needed. The kids especially liked the snow park where there were sleds for rent and toys provided. Besides, the hotel is next to one of the best and biggest shopping outlets in Japan so you can do some shopping after skiing too. The only downside of this hotel is that the snow is manmade (in December at least). It is no powder snow but the kids enjoyed learning to ski and playing in the snow park anyhow.\nGot the connecting room for 4 people, and it was nice and very clean. Rooms in Japan are known to be very small but we fit comfortably. They have a back exit directly going to Tanukikoji so it was very convenient.

There are many restaurants and stores nearby and I seem to remember some kind of festival happening in a square nearby when I was there earlier.  Someone told me the restaurant in the hotel is good, but I've never eaten there so I can't say for sure.  Also Ikebukuro is one of the major hubs on the Yamanote line which allows you to get to other places pretty easily as long as you aren't travelling during rush hour.\n\nService:\nI've always had stellar service in Japan, and this place was no different.  I thought it was on par with the business hotels that I have stayed at in Shinagawa when I am in Tokyo on business.\n\nRoom:\nThe rooms were not huge, but by Japanese standards they were pretty big.  Compared to hotels I've stayed at for vacation they were a bit bigger, and compared to the hotels I get when on business they were a bit smaller, but really I felt like it was a good size where it wasn't just bed + desk + small pathway that has a small bathroom on the side that I've seen at a few hotels in Japan.  I need a bit of space to stretch out and it worked out well for me.\n\nOverall I felt that this was a good value for the quality that you receive.\nI love this hotel! Was scouring the internet for hotels near USJ and came across this gem. It did not have a lot of reviews when I booked it but from the ones that were left, I was hooked.

It did not have a lot of reviews when I booked it but from the ones that were left, I was hooked. So I booked a 2-night stay for a family holiday and it did not disappoint. One, it is really near Universal City Station (by near I mean adjacent to it). Universal City Walk is a minute walk while Universal Studio Japan is at most  a 5-min walk. Since it is really near Universal City Station, going anywhere in Osaka does not take too long. We went to Dotonbori on our 1st night there. Two, it is new (opened in 2017 I think). Three, the room is spacious (I booked a corner room so it might be bias). Four, the staff are really helpful and super friendly. The cherry on top is certainly the Skyspa on the top floor. (For beginners, i.e 1st time traveller to Japan, it is sort of like a hot spring in the hotel. What you do is you go up to the 14th floor, bring the hand towel provided by the hotel and wear the yukata prepared by the hotel. Bathe before you go into the hot spring and bathe again after. One crucial thing is you have to be naked at the soaking area. You can bring the small hand towel with you but do not wet it at the pool. All your belongings must be stored in the lockers provided and this should go without saying that phones and cameras are not allowed in the spa.)\nNo downside to this hotel although if you want to be picky then the breakfast might not suit your palate as it caters mostly to the locals. My family and I love it tho. Another unique thing about the hotel is the amenities are given freely at the lobby, so a little self restraint is advised. \nIn conclusion, this hotel has met my expectations and more. Will definitely stay here again when we come back.\nMy family (6 adults) really enjoyed our stay here on Nov 1-Nov 4, and again on Nov 7-Nov 8, 2009.  It is easily accessible from Narita airport via Airport Limousine Bus (they have their own bus stop) as well as by Japan Rail.

It is easily accessible from Narita airport via Airport Limousine Bus (they have their own bus stop) as well as by Japan Rail.  In fact, the hotel is on top of the subway & the Yamamote JR line, which allowed us to go EVERYWHERE without ever touching a taxi.  The staff was courteous and friendly, and allowed us to hold luggage since we arrived too early for check-in, and also held luggage for us for several hours prior to our flight home.  \n\nWe stayed on the 16th & 18th floors, both which had excellent views to our right of Shibuya crossing (the one with all the lights from any movie about modern Japan), but best views of the crossing come from the elevators and lobby.  The rooms are small by American standards, and beds are smaller than Queen sized, but still fit two comfortably enough, and the bathrooms came equipped with shampoo, conditioner, body soap, as well as toothbrushes, combs, razors, etc.  There was also an empty mini-fridge available for storing snacks as well as hot water for tea/coffee.  Beware of the tv remote, because it can be easy to hit the PPV buttons by accident.  Fortunately, you won't get charged unless you agree to accept the charges.  Which reminds me, the hotel has pay-per-use computers for internet in the lobby, but if you bring your own laptop, internet is free within the room (they have a cable available for use).\n\nHelpful hint - prices were definitely a better value when we booked for more than night.\n\nAll-in-all, fantastic hotel for location & convenience!\nThis is the best experience I've ever had regardless of price.

I've stayed at hotels all over Asia and little in Europe half the price and 3x the price.\n\nI've arrived at the above opinion 1 day into my 3 day stay, it was THAT good and it only got better even after I checked-out!\n\nUpon arrive we were notified the grade of our room was full and was upgraded without hesitation.  I'm constantly surprised how many hotel try to hesitate on this obviously only thing to do.\n\nThe term \"Hotel\" in Japan means a different thing than in the West, and I can assure you no matter where you come from this hotel will not be considered \"small\" like others in Japan.  This is a proper Western sized hotel.\n\nWe got a huge room with a large queen bed with wall to wall floor to ceiling window view of the whole Shinjuku district, to get a better view you probably have to go to the Shinjuku Gov building's observation floor.\n\nI could go into infinity details, but I will just say, the Japanese are really into details.  In a totally anal sense, and the room was prepared and equipped to the best of their abilities.  There are things and service in the room that you wouldn't think of needing, because they've thought about everything.  \n\nFor those of you backpackers who think you just need a room, you need to find something 1/2 of this price or else you are not getting good value.  For those traveling with family like me, we need service!  Like letting our 8yr old stay in the room without extra charge.  Having a convenience store in the hotel.  Airport shuttle at the lobby.  Bath products that will make all the ladies scream.  Close but not in the middle of it all in Shinjuku so we can have a relaxing stay, but also a covered conveyor belt walk way into the metro station, that make a huge difference during the rain!\n\nThe whole service got even better after we checked out.  I accidently left 2 expensive polo shirts and worse of all a stack of cash and only set of car keys in the room.  I didn't rea\nExcellent hotel in the heart of Higashiyama!

Easy to find (as its the only hotel on the island). \nBeds were comfy, rooms were quiet with brilliant blackout curtains (just what overnight travellers like ourselves needed. Why its very popular with Airline staff too)\nWe had a standard twin room which had 2 comfy double beds which was just what we needed for a good nights sleep (mind you, we were a tad too excited to really sleep as we were in Japan!). Considering how close the hotel is to a busy international airport, you couldnt hear the planes (or trains as was also a Shinkansen nearby)\nThe myth that all Japan hotel rooms are tiny was not true here as room was very big & great value for the money. \nStaff polite, efficient, helpful. \nThe adjoining Airport is wonderful - lots of places to eat and shop and easy to get around. \nWe would definitely stay here again if we visited lovely Japan\nI couldn't find a thing that make me dissappointed with Nikko Hotel.

The staffs really showed how a 5 star hotel should be. We were greeted by a bell captain who spoke perfect English ( one you found seldom happen even in a 5 star hotel in Japan), he accomodate our needs to leave the baggages in Nikko while we traveled to other places, since we arrived very early and could not check in yet. By the time we checked in, the front office staff was also polite and efficient. \r\n\r\nThe room gave us a surprise since the size was very spacious for the standard room in Japan. The over the standard toiletries made us very happy also. It seems that Nikko Hotel really take a good care of his customer.\r\n\r\nNikko hotel is located very near to Hakata station, which is a central station for bus, train and shinkansen in Fukuoka. It is surrounded by many big shopping malls also. \r\n\r\nI must say, it is a perfect hotel for a long stay! (Because 1 night here was not enough for us).\nLocation is right near the Shibuya Station, you need to use the crossing bridge to go to the hotel.

We came from Narita to the hotel via N'Ex plus local train and found it should have been more comfortable if we had chosen the airport bus. Nevertheless, it was a worthwhile when we found our room with such a breathtaking view. The room is large relative to other hotels in Japan.  The hotel facilities and the staff are great too.  Access to nearby shopping malls like Aqua City is convenient with just a few steps away from the hotel. The hotel also provides scheduled shuttle bus to guests visiting Tokyo Disneyland with advance booking required. Overall, this hotel is really value. We would definite to be back there again in our next visit to Tokyo.\nIt is a very good Five Stars hotel in Japan. 7 minutes walking distance from JR Sapporo train station. As soon as you get in the hotel front entrance, you will find hotel is waiting to serve you, you do not need to wait to get your service, the real five stars service. And the free WIFI will be avalible for all your gears. One word to comment the stay is excellent.\nFor a local hotel in Japan, it was very spacious. The interior design is very chic and cosy. The walking space is just enough to have your luggage laid open and meander through. The lighting is good. The TV has two English channels: BBC and HBO.

The interior design is very chic and cosy. The walking space is just enough to have your luggage laid open and meander through. The lighting is good. The TV has two English channels: BBC and HBO. The bed is comfortable for me, and perhaps a second person about my height of 160cm. I traveled alone so the space was more than enough, but if its 2 people or more, it would be bit of a squeeze. The bathroom is spacious. The mirror is heated at the area directly above the sink so don't worry about foggy mirrors. The water pressure in the shower is amazing, especially after a long day out.\n\nBecause it's located next to a major mall, food and other necessities are just a stroll away. If you want a choice away from the mall, there's a lot of cafes, restaurants and bars along the streets surrounding the hotel. You will never be lacking in food and drink. Hotel breakfast has a wide variety and is very, very tasty.\n\nThere are two subway stations next to the hotel that are near major train interchanges so you're connected to any part of the city. They are not JR Railways, but they are connected to them, although you'll have to purchase tickets to non-JR subway lines.\n\nOverall, this hotel is fantastic.\nI was about to do some exercises during my stay, Coronavirus was widely spreading, I need to boost my immunity.

Common sense.. They have a gym, but they wanted to charge me 5000++ yen for per entry. If every hotel in Japan are doing in the same fashion, the staff should explain to me patiently.. When I say on the phone to her: I need to exercise to fight the virus, if you don’t give me access, I might write a negative review on this. I never had to pay so much for using the gym as a hotel guest. The hotel lady on the phone said: “Ok, go ahead...you can write what you want...”! \nObviously she didn’t care how I felt and what I would write. She doesn’t want to explain. Not experienced in handling customer satisfaction.\n\nI was not notified, I have to pay for using the gym.

The dining options are ordinary but I really appreciated the fact that the breakfast coupons are interchangeable with other meals and even drinks at the bar. This alone makes the stay far more pleasant as you can exchange a breakfast for a lunch buffet if you decide to sleep in or skip breakfast completely.\n\nThis is very much a family focused resort and I regret not bringing my young daughter to this place (perhaps I will get a chance to if I bring her to Okinawa in the future). It is NOT a place to have rowdy guests who like to cause a ruckus (!).\nLocated inside Tokyo station was the perfect location. Staff were super nice and very attentive, especially bellboy services.

The wifi signal was weak so, I couldn't connect to the internet for my entire stay.\nIf you're looking for a hotel in Osaka that is central and yet not so busy, this hotel best suits your needs.

Never been a fan of a big hotel, however I have found this hotel to be an exception. As I was travelling to many cities in Japan, staying in a hotel next to a train station was somewhat make sense, and this hotel is basically right next to Osaka station. Breakfast was lovely, many selections and they were all great. Fitness facility was outstanding (the best I have found yet). Having a great restaurant up at the top floor was a big plus for anyone who fancy staying in. The only let down for me was the staff performance. There was nothing wrong but the level of services and the welcomeness was not as high as any other places I went to in Japan. (Normally I would give 10/10 for any hotels in Japan, but for this Hilton, maybe a 7 or 8/10).\nWE LOVE THIS PLACE!\n\nThis hotel is the highlight of our 10 days Japan visit, it's not cheap but it totally worth the money as the dinner is just amazing (7 courses) and you really get to have the best meal you can possibly think of.

The breakfast is also good but do remember to take whatever you want to refill before 9:30am as they will start packing up at 9:45am. We love the room, spacious, clean, the bed is extremely comfortable\nand the you can enjoy the onsen in your own balcony. I also strongly recommend you try the public onsen it's just super cool. They swap the places for ladies and gentlemen alternatively which is good so that you can see different type of the onsen. Try the outdoor one and when you are soaking into the onsen whilst surrounded by the mountains and trees, it's beyond description. Do remember to follow the sign that clearly indicates the dos and donts in the public onsen and have fun! If you can, also sign up for the early morning yoga which is at 7am daily!\nIt was one the most recommended hotel if u bring small children.

The staff was sorry we had to wait two hours in the beautiful bar with garden fountain view and upgraded us for free in a marvellous 60 sq mt suite with Tokyo Tower panoramic view.  The hotel and the service are really 5 stars.\r\nThere are two subway stations very close to the hotel (Akabanebashi - 3 min walk, Shibakoen - 5 min walk) plus free shuttle to Hamamatsucho railway station, which make the transportation very easy. \r\nDon't miss Katsura Kobe Restaurant on the 1st basement. In two weeks in Japan we ate 5 times Kobe and Hida beef and this one was by far the best. The Kobe steak is very expensive, about 130 Euro for 150 gr, but after it the best filet mignon or prime rib will seem to you  without taste.\r\nThe next time we'll go to Tokyo we'll stay definitely in The Prince Park Tower.\nIt was very nice and good.

This hotel literally opened two days prior to our arrival and I don't think our room had been ever used.  The staff was super friendly and eager to help out.  One of the staff, Sasaki, helped us order a portable WiFi device since we realized Japan's free Wifi was not as accessible as Korea's.  We also wanted to exchange some currency as some hotels in Korea had good exchange rates, but Sasaki found us a location near the Ginza shopping area that had better rates.  The staff of the hotel is one of the best I've come across.  I think my only minor gripe is the rooms are really tight.\nWith comparison to big names, i am sure Brighton surpasses all expectations, hands down.\n1) checked in and was welcomed by lobby greeters and the front desk lady was extremely well versed in intoducing the hotel and its surrounding attractions, with an English accent.\n2) proximity to the main attraction, Sento and imperial palace.

Though no close stations or subways, the hotel provides free return shuttle service to the city station, which was a 7mins comfortable mini bus service.\n3) hotel decor and design is very elegant, rooms are extremely spacious with comparisons to japan hotel room sizes. The room us well fitted with a big bath and surprise surprise, they provide bath salts! As the hotel has a 29 years history, i am sure they just had their recent facelift.\n4) lastly, a very big thank you for the kind service from housekeeping staff Nishida for the kind thoughts. Reason was i had difficulty disposing kids diapers and it was realised immediately abeit the stench ;) the problem was resolved with an airtight bin sent to the room the following day without me asking for help. A card was left to ensure everything was in place.

Subway station is also just next door. sufficient choices of restaurants / foods in the plaza just in front. also, there is a Lawson convenience store right at the lobby level of the hotel. i love the minimalism design of the room, which i think is very neat and efficient. the only downside about the room is that they do not have any king-size bed in the whole hotel, not so couple-friendly. but i guess this is the common practice in many hotels in Japan.\r\n\r\nalso, we needed to hire a van taxi to go to the airport. i had to go three times to the concierge, assisted by the same lady. on the first two requests, we only said the estimate price but said that the service was full on my day of departure. only after i tried again for the third time, talking to the same person, sharing my urgency why i really need the service, that she went ahead to try calling several taxi companies she has already had on her file since the very beginning. she managed to get me the van booked only after her second try. it was helpful, but definitely would have been a lot more helpful if she can just do it right the first time.Show moreDavid, IndonesiaNest Hotel Tokyo Hanzomon8.6 ExcellentBased on 3089 reviewsnot very close to shopping area but hotel is good and new\nsame as other japan hotel , it is very small but it is goodCHAN, Hong Kong SAR, ChinaHotel Resol Kyoto Shijo Muromachi8.9 ExcellentBased on 5806 reviewsCan tell it's a new hotel with its cleanness and modern design.

The breakfast was one of the best of the hotels we stayed in during our trip to Tokyo and the croissants possibly the best I’ve ever had. I would recommend paying the extra for the premium rooms as these were much larger than you normally find in Japan and had a few extras like a daily drink coupon, better in room complimentary drinks and snack.

My first time in Japan and this business hotel is located near a major train station, Nippori Station. Very convenient to travel to just about anywhere in Tokyo and to and from Narita Airport. Might be confusing at first to use their train and metro but then I have my best friend with me which is Google Maps and Japan Travel apps and it made my solo trip seamless when it comes to trasportation.  Lot’s of restaurants nearby, convenient stores and drugstores that sells almost anything you might need. Yanaka Ginza, a quaint landmark in Tokyo is very near, about 15 mins walk from the hotel which I explored on the last day of my trip. I would not hesitate to recommend this hotel because of its customer service and convenience, though as you have read in other reviews that the rooms are small, and it is, might need a lot of manuevering around for 2 people but over all it was good experience for me.

I'm constantly surprised how many hotel try to hesitate on this obviously only thing to do.\n\nThe term \"Hotel\" in Japan means a different thing than in the West, and I can assure you no matter where you come from this hotel will not be considered \"small\" like others in Japan.  This is a proper Western sized hotel.\n\nWe got a huge room with a large queen bed with wall to wall floor to ceiling window view of the whole Shinjuku district, to get a better view you probably have to go to the Shinjuku Gov building's observation floor.\n\nI could go into infinity details, but I will just say, the Japanese are really into details.  In a totally anal sense, and the room was prepared and equipped to the best of their abilities.  There are things and service in the room that you wouldn't think of needing, because they've thought about everything.  \n\nFor those of you backpackers who think you just need a room, you need to find something 1/2 of this price or else you are not getting good value.  For those traveling with family like me, we need service!  Like letting our 8yr old stay in the room without extra charge.  Having a convenience store in the hotel.  Airport shuttle at the lobby.  Bath products that will make all the ladies scream.  Close but not in the middle of it all in Shinjuku so we can have a relaxing stay, but also a covered conveyor belt walk way into the metro station, that make a huge difference during the rain!\n\nThe whole service got even better after we checked out.

The dormitory itself is great, you get a cubicle with a bed, a little security box, an outlet, and some space to put your stuff. The room is air conditioned at night, and the bed is comfy enough to not have any problems sleeping.\n\nAlthough, the room itself is quite small, and thus the beds are quite short, best suited for someone under 180 cm (otherwise your feet would stick out from your cubicle.) The hallway lights in the room is always on, so you won't get a pitch black environment to sleep in (but the curtains are probably adequate in blocking the light for most.) And like most dormitories, you won't get much audio privacy.\n\nThe toilets are small and slightly dirty. The showers, however are great. There are amenities provided, although there is no place to dry your towel, so that might become a problem.\n\nThe location is not hard to get to, but it doesn't stand out, so you might just not notice it. But it is away from the main road, away from the traffic and noises in the night, great for a quiet place to rest.Show moreChawit, ThailandOsaka Guesthouse HIVE7.7 Very goodBased on 447 reviewsLocation is a little bit hard to find and a bit far from the station But everything was nice.\r\nit was really clean, and their staffs were so kind.\r\nI joined their okonomiyaki party.

I even got to Ise for a day trip but just walking around the streets of Tennoji and the geeki Den Den Town can be very fun. \n\n\nEven if you decide just to stay at the house is a great plan, the atmosphere is relaxed and there is always someone to talk with. On days I just wanted to rest I meet so many good people in Sachi. Both foreigners and Japanese, short and long term residents live in harmony and are willing to share. You might even be able to participate on the fun parties organized by the staff and the residents. \nFinally, I want to thank all the nice and attentive members of the staff with which I spent the most time with and to the manager who is a very caring and considerate person, a cool pianist and super good cook. \nI cannot wait to go back to Sachi on Spring!Show moreTomás, ChilePark Inn7 GoodBased on 1449 reviewsGood location, only 5 mins from Nankai(train for Kansai airport) Osaka metro, JR. \nThe building is old but you can tell they do the best to keep it clean with this low price.\nReception open hour is limited, but didn't cause inconvince to me, and the staffs were so nice and welling to help. \nThe bath is shared(separate man and female by time), means you may be naked wit...Good location, only 5 mins from Nankai(train for Kansai airport) Osaka metro, JR. \nThe building is old but you can tell they do the best to keep it clean with this low price.\nReception open hour is limited, but didn't cause inconvince to me, and the staffs were so nice and welling to help. \nThe bath is shared(separate man and female by time), means you may be naked with other people around. No need to feel shy since you're enjoying the very Japanese traditional style living.\n\nThe wall is thin so you can hear other people if they speak loudly.

I had a really nice experience here, overall. The staff were warm and welcoming and the whole guesthouse had the same atmosphere. It’s the kind of place you can sit down in the common area and have a conversation with anyone around. \nWith that said, there were two things I think are worth mentioning that did not spoil my experience but maybe could be approved upon. The first was the overall temperature of the guesthouse. It was freezing, especially at night. My top bunk was next to the window and I’m sure there’s no insulation there because the cold comes right through. \nSecondly, the smell of my particular room was the essence of a high school boy’s locker room. I walked into other rooms to see if it carried the same stench and they did not. Therefore it was the specific guys that were in my room. However, I think the guesthouse could do to post signs that explain and encourage how to keep a sanitary environment (as I have seen is customary in japan). For instance, one of the cupboards used to store baggage was filled with one guy’s clothes (both clean and dirty I presume from the smell). This could be helped with more attention to upkeep, I believe. \nStill I appreciated my experience with this guesthouse.Show moreJayzell, ThailandKhaosan World Namba8.6 ExcellentBased on 2488 reviewsI booked a room with 6 beds (3 bunk beds) for 6 people, and I would say that I really enjoyed to stay here.

The room is quite big (for Osaka or Japan), and quite cheap. It's famous for backpackers or young people. The room is clean, and there is a bathroom inside the room only for SHOWER. If you want to use toilet then there is a shared toilet in each floor, which is CLEAN! But, they separate the toilet for women and men, so for example in my floor, the toilet is for men only, so for women, they have to go upstair or downstair (using lift or just on foot). I would say the location is the strongest selling point of this hotel. It's located in the heart of Namba area, it's near Namba station (I would say the exit nomor 30 is the best, because there is an elevator there, and it is inside the OCAT building. The intercity bus also in the OCAT building, so for those who want to use the intercity bus, you just need to walk less than 300 meter from the hotel!). There are many restaurants near the hotel, like Sukiya (cheap food), and also near Dotonbori. It's a good hotel in the prime location!.Show moreGunawan, IndonesiaDeer Guesthouse8.6 ExcellentBased on 149 reviewsIf you are looking for a home away from home, I would recommend for you to stay at Deer Guesthouse.

That said, this placr is fantastic,  no murders no anal rape-age, just a chep, clean hostel thats a two minute walk from the station and a ton of famous tourist areas.  It's all family run so don't expect Jeeves and Mr. Belvedere to double team you with room service.  But for this price expect a good cheap clean room.  The showers are shared (seperated by gender though, ofc) so that might have put some people off, but honestly that's how a lot of the showers are in Japan, and certainly how all the ones in an onsen (sauna) are.

Yet they still did. I felt bad and heart-warmed at the same time (Thank you, Ichiran ramen was awesome!), couldn't stay long but I imagine you'd have a wonderful day in Osaka just hanging out with them alone.\r\n\r\nAlso they'd silently change your towels like ninja and clean the shower few times a day, so you can't really blame them if still seeing something you don't like.\r\n\r\nIn terms of facilities, it's an open space for many beds in entirely floor (I usually come back very late, so if you see bad reviews about noise around sep. 14-18, that'd prob. be me :/), there are curtains as doors which you can hear people whispering or outside door sounds. I suggest guesthouse could sell ear plugs or bring your own.\r\nI stayed at 2nd floor and there was a long desk with chairs, water heater next to the beds, but you'll have to fill the water at 1st floor which opened until 10 pm.\r\nTho there are many vending machines outside 24hr. or shower water which I drank (shower room is awesome!). There's also a washing/drying machine.\r\n3rd floor has a balcony for smoking area (I didn't go up there so don't really know about it or 1st floor room).

You can then walk right to Shinsaibashi which is just on the west end of Dontonbori. To the south, it is about 5 minutes' walk to Kuromon Market where you can buy really good toro and grilled seafood from stalls, many of which provide seating. Walk further for about 20 minutes is Namba where there are department stores etc. Overall, we liked the location but it can be awkward to get to via metro if you have heavy luggage. We took the Keihan Railway from Kyoto and then took the metro which got us to Nippombashi Station. Then it was a 100 meter walk to the north. However, when we departed, we decided to take the Nankai Railway to Kansai International Airport, and we had to walk with luggage for 20 minutes to Namba Station. We were ok although we would not recommend it if you have a lot of luggage.\n\nThe hotel is brand new and very nicely decorated. Note that you need to place your shoes in lockers before entering into the main areas of the hotel. If it was not for a strain of hair that we found on the floor in our room, we would have given full marks on cleanliness. We had a Moderate Twin Room and the beds, pillows and duvet were really comfortable. Aircon and wifi were great, with coffee and tea making available. Room was on the small side, but there was enough space and we had seen smaller rooms in nicer hotels in Japan so no complaints.\n\nStaff scored top marks from us as they were extremely pro-active and helpful, and spoke very good English. On the first day, we arrived before check-in time, so we deposited our luggage and went out.

They helped me work out the local express bus times so that we could go to Churaumi Aquarium and booked a taxi for us to get to the bus stop. Though I speak a little Japanese, many of the staff speak English exceptionally well so I never felt that I couldn't communicate with them.\n\nThe room was really spacious and we had a lovely view of the water and the planes landing at the airport. During the night we had no troubles with noise pollution because the doors and double-sealed. The room was always spotless and the bath was big enough for two.\n\nThe breakfast was really delicious with many kinds of foods and even some Okinawan specialties. The view while eating breakfast was really lovely too because you gaze over the pool to the nearby beach as you sip your coffee. We also had dinner one of the nights from the local Italian restaurant (next to the hotel) and it was really nice. The view was beautiful and you can have your food out looking over the ocean.\n\nMy favourite part of the stay though? The onsen! I have only been to four different onsens in Japan so far but this was the best one I have been to yet. The standing pool was divine! I loved gazing out at the lights in the distance on a balmy night immersed up to the shoulders in the standing pool. It was so relaxing and the water quality is very good, plus the onsen facilities were all spotlessly clean.\n\nThe only thing I would note is that you are on a small island near the airport so if you don't have a hire car you will need to use taxis or the hotel's shuttle service to get to the monorail line (which ends at the airport).\n\nOverall our stay was lovely and really memorable. I highly recommend Ryukyu Onsen Sengajima Hotel if you want to relax in a scenic, comfortable setting and have the use of a great quality onsen with kind and helpful staff.Show moreSarah, AustraliaHotel Monterey Le Frere Osaka8.6 ExcellentBased on 7062 reviewsStay with Hotel Monterey Le Frere Osaka during our honeymoon.

He also patiently explained to us about the pricing. As this is our first time trying this luggage delivery arrangement, his help really put us at ease.  His name starts with T (i really regretted not getting his name). We are really grateful for his help and service!\n\nHotel wise, it's clean and in a peaceful neighborhood.

The kids especially liked the snow park where there were sleds for rent and toys provided. Besides, the hotel is next to one of the best and biggest shopping outlets in Japan so you can do some shopping after skiing too. The only downside of this hotel is that the snow is manmade (in December at least).

There are many restaurants and stores nearby and I seem to remember some kind of festival happening in a square nearby when I was there earlier.  Someone told me the restaurant in the hotel is good, but I've never eaten there so I can't say for sure.  Also Ikebukuro is one of the major hubs on the Yamanote line which allows you to get to other places pretty easily as long as you aren't travelling during rush hour.\n\nService:\nI've always had stellar service in Japan, and this place was no different.  I thought it was on par with the business hotels that I have stayed at in Shinagawa when I am in Tokyo on business.\n\nRoom:\nThe rooms were not huge, but by Japanese standards they were pretty big.  Compared to hotels I've stayed at for vacation they were a bit bigger, and compared to the hotels I get when on business they were a bit smaller, but really I felt like it was a good size where it wasn't just bed + desk + small pathway that has a small bathroom on the side that I've seen at a few hotels in Japan.  I need a bit of space to stretch out and it worked out well for me.\n\nOverall I felt that this was a good value for the quality that you receive.Show moreAndrew, United StatesThe Singulari Hotel & Skyspa at Universal Studios Japan9 ExceptionalBased on 13303 reviewsI love this hotel!

It did not have a lot of reviews when I booked it but from the ones that were left, I was hooked. So I booked a 2-night stay for a family holiday and it did not disappoint. One, it is really near Universal City Station (by near I mean adjacent to it). Universal City Walk is a minute walk while Universal Studio Japan is at most  a 5-min walk. Since it is really near Universal City Station, going anywhere in Osaka does not take too long. We went to Dotonbori on our 1st night there. Two, it is new (opened in 2017 I think). Three, the room is spacious (I booked a corner room so it might be bias). Four, the staff are really helpful and super friendly. The cherry on top is certainly the Skyspa on the top floor. (For beginners, i.e 1st time traveller to Japan, it is sort of like a hot spring in the hotel. What you do is you go up to the 14th floor, bring the hand towel provided by the hotel and wear the yukata prepared by the hotel. Bathe before you go into the hot spring and bathe again after. One crucial thing is you have to be naked at the soaking area. You can bring the small hand towel with you but do not wet it at the pool. All your belongings must be stored in the lockers provided and this should go without saying that phones and cameras are not allowed in the spa.)\nNo downside to this hotel although if you want to be picky then the breakfast might not suit your palate as it caters mostly to the locals. My family and I love it tho. Another unique thing about the hotel is the amenities are given freely at the lobby, so a little self restraint is advised. \nIn conclusion, this hotel has met my expectations and more. Will definitely stay here again when we come back.Show moreVANESSA, MalaysiaHotel New Hankyu Osaka8.4 ExcellentBased on 23917 reviewsMitsui Garden Hotel Shiodome Italia-gai / Tokyo8.4 ExcellentBased on 7916 reviewsShibuya Excel Hotel Tokyu8.7 ExcellentBased on 11081 reviewsMy family (6 adults) really enjoyed our stay here on Nov 1-Nov 4, and again on Nov 7-Nov 8, 2009.

It is easily accessible from Narita airport via Airport Limousine Bus (they have their own bus stop) as well as by Japan Rail.  In fact, the hotel is on top of the subway & the Yamamote JR line, which allowed us to go EVERYWHERE without ever touching a taxi.  The staff was courteous and friendly, and allowed us to hold luggage since we arrived too early for check-in, and also held luggage for us for several hours prior to our flight home.  \n\nWe stayed on the 16th & 18th floors, both which had excellent views to our right of Shibuya crossing (the one with all the lights from any movie about modern Japan), but best views of the crossing come from the elevators and lobby.  The rooms are small by American standards, and beds are smaller than Queen sized, but still fit two comfortably enough, and the bathrooms came equipped with shampoo, conditioner, body soap, as well as toothbrushes, combs, razors, etc.  There was also an empty mini-fridge available for storing snacks as well as hot water for tea/coffee.  Beware of the tv remote, because it can be easy to hit the PPV buttons by accident.  Fortunately, you won't get charged unless you agree to accept the charges.  Which reminds me, the hotel has pay-per-use computers for internet in the lobby, but if you bring your own laptop, internet is free within the room (they have a cable available for use).\n\nHelpful hint - prices were definitely a better value when we booked for more than night.\n\nAll-in-all, fantastic hotel for location & convenience!Show moreMilly, United StatesLuxury hotels in JapanKeio Plaza Hotel Tokyo8.6 ExcellentBased on 16229 reviewsThis is the best experience I've ever had regardless of price.

I'm constantly surprised how many hotel try to hesitate on this obviously only thing to do.\n\nThe term \"Hotel\" in Japan means a different thing than in the West, and I can assure you no matter where you come from this hotel will not be considered \"small\" like others in Japan.  This is a proper Western sized hotel.\n\nWe got a huge room with a large queen bed with wall to wall floor to ceiling window view of the whole Shinjuku district, to get a better view you probably have to go to the Shinjuku Gov building's observation floor.\n\nI could go into infinity details, but I will just say, the Japanese are really into details.  In a totally anal sense, and the room was prepared and equipped to the best of their abilities.  There are things and service in the room that you wouldn't think of needing, because they've thought about everything.  \n\nFor those of you backpackers who think you just need a room, you need to find something 1/2 of this price or else you are not getting good value.  For those traveling with family like me, we need service!  Like letting our 8yr old stay in the room without extra charge.  Having a convenience store in the hotel.  Airport shuttle at the lobby.  Bath products that will make all the ladies scream.  Close but not in the middle of it all in Shinjuku so we can have a relaxing stay, but also a covered conveyor belt walk way into the metro station, that make a huge difference during the rain!\n\nThe whole service got even better after we checked out.

The bed is comfortable for me, and perhaps a second person about my height of 160cm. I traveled alone so the space was more than enough, but if its 2 people or more, it would be bit of a squeeze. The bathroom is spacious. The mirror is heated at the area directly above the sink so don't worry about foggy mirrors. The water pressure in the shower is amazing, especially after a long day out.\n\nBecause it's located next to a major mall, food and other necessities are just a stroll away. If you want a choice away from the mall, there's a lot of cafes, restaurants and bars along the streets surrounding the hotel. You will never be lacking in food and drink. Hotel breakfast has a wide variety and is very, very tasty.\n\nThere are two subway stations next to the hotel that are near major train interchanges so you're connected to any part of the city.

As I was travelling to many cities in Japan, staying in a hotel next to a train station was somewhat make sense, and this hotel is basically right next to Osaka station. Breakfast was lovely, many selections and they were all great. Fitness facility was outstanding (the best I have found yet). Having a great restaurant up at the top floor was a big plus for anyone who fancy staying in. The only let down for me was the staff performance. There was nothing wrong but the level of services and the welcomeness was not as high as any other places I went to in Japan. (Normally I would give 10/10 for any hotels in Japan, but for this Hilton, maybe a 7 or 8/10).Show moreItti, ThailandHakone Kowakien TEN-YU8.9 ExcellentBased on 3687 reviewsWE LOVE THIS PLACE!\n\nThis hotel is the highlight of our 10 days Japan visit, it's not cheap but it totally worth the money as the dinner is just amazing (7 courses) and you really get to have the best meal you can possibly think of.

We love the room, spacious, clean, the bed is extremely comfortable\nand the you can enjoy the onsen in your own balcony. I also strongly recommend you try the public onsen it's just super cool. They swap the places for ladies and gentlemen alternatively which is good so that you can see different type of the onsen. Try the outdoor one and when you are soaking into the onsen whilst surrounded by the mountains and trees, it's beyond description. Do remember to follow the sign that clearly indicates the dos and donts in the public onsen and have fun! If you can, also sign up for the early morning yoga which is at 7am daily!Show moreRui, ChinaHotel New Otani Osaka8.7 ExcellentBased on 5025 reviewsIt was one the most recommended hotel if u bring small children.

In 2010, festivities are in the works to celebrate this ancient city's anniversary. \"Old Japan\" is still easy to spot here, from Great Buddha Hall to traditional ryokans and the serene Isuien garden. travellers rave about walking tours of Nara, particularly in the historic Naramachi merchant area.Read more\nHigashiomiRead more\nOsakaHome to nearly nine million and powering an economy that exceeds both Hong Kong's and Thailand's, Osaka packs quite a punch. The confident, stylish city is a shopping hub, with fabulous restaurants and nightlife. It's an ideal base for exploring the Kansai region: Kyoto's World Heritage Sites, Nara's temple and Koya-san's eerie graves are within 90 minutes by train. Top city attractions include the aquarium, Osaka Castle, Universal Studios Japan and the futuristic Floating Garden Observatory.Read more\nTakashimaRead more\nHashimotoRead more\nNagoyaCommerce keeps Nagoya’s downtown popping with life, but there’s more than just manufacturing to this industrial powerhouse. Nagoyans meet for plates of crisp-friend miso katsu; make weekend trips to nearby Shinto shrines; and count down the days to the city’s autumn Nagoya Festival.Read more\nKainanRead more\nAwaji-shimaRead more\nSingaporeSingapore is known as a bustling metropolis that also happens to be one of the cleanest and safest cities of its size in the world. (Just make sure you heed the local laws—something like spitting in the street might merely be considered rude in your hometown, but here, it carries a severe penalty.) You'll find historic sites like the Thian Hock Keng temple, superlative shopping (including gargantuan malls) and numerous beaches.Read more\nVaranasiThe north Indian city of Varanasi, or Benares, is regarded as sacred by Hindus, Buddhists and Jains. Situated in the fertile Ganga valley and on the banks of the Ganges, Varanasi is a place of pilgrimage for Hindus, who come to bathe in the holy river. Known as the City of Temples and a beacon of culture, Varanasi has produced many renowned writers. It’s also a centre of silk weaving, so practise haggling at the chaotic bazaar for some beautiful souvenirs. Rickshaws are the best way to get about.Read more\nNew DelhiLaid out by British architect Edwin Lutyens, the Indian capital is a striking modern metropolis. A gracious contrast to Old Delhi's winding streets, the grand avenues and stately buildings of New Delhi are rich with history and culture, from Gandhi's Delhi home (and the site of his assassination) to the tomb of Humayun, a complex of Mughal buildings reminiscent of the Taj Mahal. Chaotic traffic is best left to the locals. Negotiate a good price for taxis or travel on the new Delhi Metro.Read more\nUdaipurUdaipur, known as the Venice of the East, boasts several sparkling lakes against a backdrop of the Aravail hills. Jag Niwas and Jag Mandir, islands in Fateh Sagar Lake, are the site of Udaipur Solar Observatory and Nehru Garden. Famous palaces include the magical Lake Palace, now a luxurious five-star hotel, and the massive City Palace on Pichola’s east bank, featuring epic courtyards and stunning paintings.Read more\nPondicherryBlossoming bougainvilleas, crumbling cathedrals on leafy boulevards and 18th-century colonial buildings colour the former French colony of Pondy, which sits on the Bay of Bengal. But it's also unmistakably Indian, with colourful festivals throughout the year, several mosques and the Sri Aurobindo Ashram. Quiet beaches stretch north and south from town, good for swimming and sunrise strolls. Pondy is a popular weekend getaway destination from Chennai and is easy to navigate on foot or by bicycle.Read more\nMumbaiMumbai (formerly known as Bombay), India, is famous for its chaotic streets. For bargains and people-watching, outdoor bazaars top the list of attractions. Popular waterfront destinations are Marine Drive, where visitors go to watch the sun set over the Arabian Sea, and the carnival-like Juhu Beach. More sightseeing options are the Gandhi Museum, in the leader's former home, and the cave temples of Elephanta Island. For tranquillity, Mumbai has many religious sites, lakes and parks.Read more\nOoty (Udhagamandalam)Popularly referred to as Ooty, this gem among southern hill resorts is covered in eucalyptus and pine trees and coffee and tea plantations. On a clear day, it's possible to see as far as the Mysore plateau from Dodabetta Peak, the district's most prominent viewpoint. The Stone House, a landmark 1822 bungalow, and St. Stephen's Church are remnants of the area's first British settlement. Also noteworthy: formal botanical gardens, a children's mini-garden and a contemporary art collection.Read more\nGoaEast meets West in this sun-soaked state, where Indian culture intertwines with Portuguese influences left over from a 500-year occupation. The beaches have long served as a magnet for serene hedonists. To the north, the tourist-centric scene is prevalent, with an international flair that is now skewing more hip than hippie. Travel south for stretches of unspoiled sand and an escape from large resorts. Temples, mosques and wildlife sanctuaries provide diversions from the beach.Read more\nPrayagrajRead more\nDowntown Hotels\nHotels with Kitchenette\nHotels with Free Breakfast\nHotels with Shuttle\nBoutique Hotels\nHistoric Hotels\nUnique Hotels\nHotels with Breakfast Buffet\nHotels with Smoking Rooms\nHoneymoon Hotels\n\n\nMAIN CONTENT:\nAsiaJapanKinkiKyoto PrefectureKyotoKyoto HotelsBudget Hotels in Kyoto{\"@context\":\"http:\\u002F\\u002Fschema.org\",\"@type\":\"BreadcrumbList\",\"itemListElement\":[{\"@type\":\"ListItem\",\"position\":\"1\",\"item\":\"https:\\u002F\\u002Fwww.tripadvisor.in\\u002FTourism-g2-Asia-Vacations.html\",\"name\":\"Asia\"},{\"@type\":\"ListItem\",\"position\":\"2\",\"item\":\"https:\\u002F\\u002Fwww.tripadvisor.in\\u002FTourism-g294232-Japan-Vacations.html\",\"name\":\"Japan\"},{\"@type\":\"ListItem\",\"position\":\"3\",\"item\":\"https:\\u002F\\u002Fwww.tripadvisor.in\\u002FTourism-g298189-Kinki-Vacations.html\",\"name\":\"Kinki\"},{\"@type\":\"ListItem\",\"position\":\"4\",\"item\":\"https:\\u002F\\u002Fwww.tripadvisor.in\\u002FTourism-g298563-Kyoto_Prefecture_Kinki-Vacations.html\",\"name\":\"Kyoto Prefecture\"},{\"@type\":\"ListItem\",\"position\":\"5\",\"item\":\"https:\\u002F\\u002Fwww.tripadvisor.in\\u002FTourism-g298564-Kyoto_Kyoto_Prefecture_Kinki-Vacations.html\",\"name\":\"Kyoto\"},{\"@type\":\"ListItem\",\"position\":\"6\",\"item\":\"https:\\u002F\\u002Fwww.tripadvisor.in\\u002FHotels-g298564-Kyoto_Kyoto_Prefecture_Kinki-Hotels.html\",\"name\":\"Kyoto Hotels\"},{\"@type\":\"ListItem\",\"position\":\"7\",\"name\":\"Budget Hotels in Kyoto\"}]}THE 10 BEST Cheap Hotels in Kyoto 2025{\"@context\":\"http:\\u002F\\u002Fschema.org\",\"@type\":\"FAQPage\",\"mainEntity\":[{\"@type\":\"Question\",\"name\":\"What are the best cheap hotels near Kiyomizu-dera Temple?\",\"acceptedAnswer\":{\"@type\":\"Answer\",\"text\":\"\\u003Cdiv class='faqItem'\\u003E\\u003Cdiv class='answer'\\u003ESome of the more popular cheap hotels near Kiyomizu-dera Temple include:\\u003C\\u002Fdiv\\u003E\\u003Cdiv class='hotels'\\u003E\\u003Ca href='\\u002FHotel_Review-g298564-d1547516-Reviews-Mume-Kyoto_Kyoto_Prefecture_Kinki.html'\\u003EMume\\u003C\\u002Fa\\u003E\\u003Cspan class='description'\\u003E -

(Just make sure you heed the local laws—something like spitting in the street might merely be considered rude in your hometown, but here, it carries a severe penalty.) You'll find historic sites like the Thian Hock Keng temple, superlative shopping (including gargantuan malls) and numerous beaches.Read moreVaranasiThe north Indian city of Varanasi, or Benares, is regarded as sacred by Hindus, Buddhists and Jains. Situated in the fertile Ganga valley and on the banks of the Ganges, Varanasi is a place of pilgrimage for Hindus, who come to bathe in the holy river. Known as the City of Temples and a beacon of culture, Varanasi has produced many renowned writers. It’s also a centre of silk weaving, so practise haggling at the chaotic bazaar for some beautiful souvenirs. Rickshaws are the best way to get about.Read moreNew DelhiLaid out by British architect Edwin Lutyens, the Indian capital is a striking modern metropolis. A gracious contrast to Old Delhi's winding streets, the grand avenues and stately buildings of New Delhi are rich with history and culture, from Gandhi's Delhi home (and the site of his assassination) to the tomb of Humayun, a complex of Mughal buildings reminiscent of the Taj Mahal. Chaotic traffic is best left to the locals. Negotiate a good price for taxis or travel on the new Delhi Metro.Read moreUdaipurUdaipur, known as the Venice of the East, boasts several sparkling lakes against a backdrop of the Aravail hills. Jag Niwas and Jag Mandir, islands in Fateh Sagar Lake, are the site of Udaipur Solar Observatory and Nehru Garden. Famous palaces include the magical Lake Palace, now a luxurious five-star hotel, and the massive City Palace on Pichola’s east bank, featuring epic courtyards and stunning paintings.Read morePondicherryBlossoming bougainvilleas, crumbling cathedrals on leafy boulevards and 18th-century colonial buildings colour the former French colony of Pondy, which sits on the Bay of Bengal. But it's also unmistakably Indian, with colourful festivals throughout the year, several mosques and the Sri Aurobindo Ashram. Quiet beaches stretch north and south from town, good for swimming and sunrise strolls. Pondy is a popular weekend getaway destination from Chennai and is easy to navigate on foot or by bicycle.Read moreMumbaiMumbai (formerly known as Bombay), India, is famous for its chaotic streets. For bargains and people-watching, outdoor bazaars top the list of attractions. Popular waterfront destinations are Marine Drive, where visitors go to watch the sun set over the Arabian Sea, and the carnival-like Juhu Beach. More sightseeing options are the Gandhi Museum, in the leader's former home, and the cave temples of Elephanta Island. For tranquillity, Mumbai has many religious sites, lakes and parks.Read moreOoty (Udhagamandalam)Popularly referred to as Ooty, this gem among southern hill resorts is covered in eucalyptus and pine trees and coffee and tea plantations. On a clear day, it's possible to see as far as the Mysore plateau from Dodabetta Peak, the district's most prominent viewpoint. The Stone House, a landmark 1822 bungalow, and St. Stephen's Church are remnants of the area's first British settlement. Also noteworthy: formal botanical gardens, a children's mini-garden and a contemporary art collection.Read moreGoaEast meets West in this sun-soaked state, where Indian culture intertwines with Portuguese influences left over from a 500-year occupation. The beaches have long served as a magnet for serene hedonists. To the north, the tourist-centric scene is prevalent, with an international flair that is now skewing more hip than hippie. Travel south for stretches of unspoiled sand and an escape from large resorts. Temples, mosques and wildlife sanctuaries provide diversions from the beach.Read morePrayagrajRead more[{\"@context\":\"http:\\u002F\\u002Fschema.org\",\"@type\":\"LocalBusiness\",\"name\":\"Singapore\",\"description\":\"\",\"url\":\"\",\"image\":\"https:\\u002F\\u002Fdynamic-media-cdn.tripadvisor.com\\u002Fmedia\\u002Fphoto-o\\u002F15\\u002F33\\u002Ffc\\u002Fb1\\u002Fsingapore.jpg?w=600&h=400&s=1\",\"address\":{\"@type\":\"PostalAddress\",\"addressCountry\":\"\",\"addressLocality\":\"\",\"addressRegion\":\"\",\"postalCode\":\"\",\"streetAddress\":\"\"}},{\"@context\":\"http:\\u002F\\u002Fschema.org\",\"@type\":\"LocalBusiness\",\"name\":\"Varanasi\",\"description\":\"\",\"url\":\"\",\"image\":\"https:\\u002F\\u002Fdynamic-media-cdn.tripadvisor.com\\u002Fmedia\\u002Fphoto-o\\u002F0a\\u002Fbe\\u002F17\\u002F41\\u002Fcaption.jpg?w=600&h=400&s=1\",\"address\":{\"@type\":\"PostalAddress\",\"addressCountry\":\"\",\"addressLocality\":\"\",\"addressRegion\":\"\",\"postalCode\":\"\",\"streetAddress\":\"\"}},{\"@context\":\"http:\\u002F\\u002Fschema.org\",\"@type\":\"LocalBusiness\",\"name\":\"New Delhi\",\"description\":\"\",\"url\":\"\",\"image\":\"https:\\u002F\\u002Fdynamic-media-cdn.tripadvisor.com\\u002Fmedia\\u002Fphoto-o\\u002F24\\u002F03\\u002F3f\\u002Ffd\\u002Fcaption.jpg?w=600&h=400&s=1&cx=2294&cy=1952&chk=v1_c3b28b866491ff3722ce\",\"address\":{\"@type\":\"PostalAddress\",\"addressCountry\":\"\",\"addressLocality\":\"\",\"addressRegion\":\"\",\"postalCode\":\"\",\"streetAddress\":\"\"}},{\"@context\":\"http:\\u002F\\u002Fschema.org\",\"@type\":\"LocalBusiness\",\"name\":\"Udaipur\",\"description\":\"\",\"url\":\"\",\"image\":\"https:\\u002F\\u002Fdynamic-media-cdn.tripadvisor.com\\u002Fmedia\\u002Fphoto-o\\u002F01\\u002Fd3\\u002F67\\u002Fe4\\u002Fsas-bahu.jpg?w=600&h=400&s=1\",\"address\":{\"@type\":\"PostalAddress\",\"addressCountry\":\"\",\"addressLocality\":\"\",\"addressRegion\":\"\",\"postalCode\":\"\",\"streetAddress\":\"\"}},{\"@context\":\"http:\\u002F\\u002Fschema.org\",\"@type\":\"LocalBusiness\",\"name\":\"Pondicherry\",\"description\":\"\",\"url\":\"\",\"image\":\"https:\\u002F\\u002Fdynamic-media-cdn.tripadvisor.com\\u002Fmedia\\u002Fphoto-o\\u002F11\\u002Ff4\\u002F3b\\u002F43\\u002Fboating.jpg?w=600&h=400&s=1\",\"address\":{\"@type\":\"PostalAddress\",\"addressCountry\":\"\",\"addressLocality\":\"\",\"addressRegion\":\"\",\"postalCode\":\"\",\"streetAddress\":\"\"}},{\"@context\":\"http:\\u002F\\u002Fschema.org\",\"@type\":\"LocalBusiness\",\"name\":\"Mumbai\",\"description\":\"\",\"url\":\"\",\"image\":\"https:\\u002F\\u002Fdynamic-media-cdn.tripadvisor.com\\u002Fmedia\\u002Fphoto-o\\u002F0b\\u002F4e\\u002F55\\u002Fe6\\u002Fchhatrapati-shivaji-terminus.jpg?w=600&h=400&s=1\",\"address\":{\"@type\":\"PostalAddress\",\"addressCountry\":\"\",\"addressLocality\":\"\",\"addressRegion\":\"\",\"postalCode\":\"\",\"streetAddress\":\"\"}},{\"@context\":\"http:\\u002F\\u002Fschema.org\",\"@type\":\"LocalBusiness\",\"name\":\"Ooty (Udhagamandalam)\",\"description\":\"\",\"url\":\"\",\"image\":\"https:\\u002F\\u002Fdynamic-media-cdn.tripadvisor.com\\u002Fmedia\\u002Fphoto-o\\u002F0a\\u002F84\\u002F3c\\u002Fbc\\u002Fupper-bhavani-lake.jpg?w=600&h=400&s=1\",\"address\":{\"@type\":\"PostalAddress\",\"addressCountry\":\"\",\"addressLocality\":\"\",\"addressRegion\":\"\",\"postalCode\":\"\",\"streetAddress\":\"\"}},{\"@context\":\"http:\\u002F\\u002Fschema.org\",\"@type\":\"LocalBusiness\",\"name\":\"Goa\",\"description\":\"\",\"url\":\"\",\"image\":\"https:\\u002F\\u002Fdynamic-media-cdn.tripadvisor.com\\u002Fmedia\\u002Fphoto-o\\u002F15\\u002F33\\u002Ffc\\u002Ff0\\u002Fgoa.jpg?w=600&h=400&s=1\",\"address\":{\"@type\":\"PostalAddress\",\"addressCountry\":\"\",\"addressLocality\":\"\",\"addressRegion\":\"\",\"postalCode\":\"\",\"streetAddress\":\"\"}},{\"@context\":\"http:\\u002F\\u002Fschema.org\",\"@type\":\"LocalBusiness\",\"name\":\"Prayagraj\",\"description\":\"\",\"url\":\"\",\"image\":\"https:\\u002F\\u002Fdynamic-media-cdn.tripadvisor.com\\u002Fmedia\\u002Fphoto-o\\u002F0f\\u002Fae\\u002Fb4\\u002F68\\u002Ffort-on-the-side.jpg?w=600&h=400&s=1\",\"address\":{\"@type\":\"PostalAddress\",\"addressCountry\":\"\",\"addressLocality\":\"\",\"addressRegion\":\"\",\"postalCode\":\"\",\"streetAddress\":\"\"}}]Popular Kyoto CategoriesDowntown HotelsHotels with KitchenetteHotels with Free BreakfastHotels with ShuttleBoutique HotelsHistoric HotelsUnique HotelsHotels with Breakfast BuffetHotels with Smoking RoomsHoneymoon HotelsCheap Hotels informationCheap Hotels Kyoto32Cheap Hotels Prices From₹3,472Cheap Hotels Reviews18,500Cheap Hotels Photos14,767Frequently Asked Questions about cheap hotelsWhat are the best cheap hotels near Kiyomizu-dera Temple?Some of the more popular cheap hotels near Kiyomizu-dera Temple include:Mume -
