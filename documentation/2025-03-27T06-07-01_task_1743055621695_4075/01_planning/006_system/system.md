In 2010, festivities are in the works to celebrate this ancient city's anniversary. \"Old Japan\" is still easy to spot here, from Great Buddha Hall to traditional ryokans and the serene Isuien garden. travellers rave about walking tours of Nara, particularly in the historic Naramachi merchant area.Read more\nHigashiomiRead more\nOsakaHome to nearly nine million and powering an economy that exceeds both Hong Kong's and Thailand's, Osaka packs quite a punch. The confident, stylish city is a shopping hub, with fabulous restaurants and nightlife. It's an ideal base for exploring the Kansai region: Kyoto's World Heritage Sites, Nara's temple and Koya-san's eerie graves are within 90 minutes by train. Top city attractions include the aquarium, Osaka Castle, Universal Studios Japan and the futuristic Floating Garden Observatory.Read more\nTakashimaRead more\nHashimotoRead more\nNagoyaCommerce keeps Nagoya‚Äôs downtown popping with life, but there‚Äôs more than just manufacturing to this industrial powerhouse. Nagoyans meet for plates of crisp-friend miso katsu; make weekend trips to nearby Shinto shrines; and count down the days to the city‚Äôs autumn Nagoya Festival.Read more\nKainanRead more\nAwaji-shimaRead more\nSingaporeSingapore is known as a bustling metropolis that also happens to be one of the cleanest and safest cities of its size in the world. (Just make sure you heed the local laws‚Äîsomething like spitting in the street might merely be considered rude in your hometown, but here, it carries a severe penalty.) You'll find historic sites like the Thian Hock Keng temple, superlative shopping (including gargantuan malls) and numerous beaches.Read more\nVaranasiThe north Indian city of Varanasi, or Benares, is regarded as sacred by Hindus, Buddhists and Jains. Situated in the fertile Ganga valley and on the banks of the Ganges, Varanasi is a place of pilgrimage for Hindus, who come to bathe in the holy river. Known as the City of Temples and a beacon of culture, Varanasi has produced many renowned writers. It‚Äôs also a centre of silk weaving, so practise haggling at the chaotic bazaar for some beautiful souvenirs. Rickshaws are the best way to get about.Read more\nNew DelhiLaid out by British architect Edwin Lutyens, the Indian capital is a striking modern metropolis. A gracious contrast to Old Delhi's winding streets, the grand avenues and stately buildings of New Delhi are rich with history and culture, from Gandhi's Delhi home (and the site of his assassination) to the tomb of Humayun, a complex of Mughal buildings reminiscent of the Taj Mahal. Chaotic traffic is best left to the locals. Negotiate a good price for taxis or travel on the new Delhi Metro.Read more\nUdaipurUdaipur, known as the Venice of the East, boasts several sparkling lakes against a backdrop of the Aravail hills. Jag Niwas and Jag Mandir, islands in Fateh Sagar Lake, are the site of Udaipur Solar Observatory and Nehru Garden. Famous palaces include the magical Lake Palace, now a luxurious five-star hotel, and the massive City Palace on Pichola‚Äôs east bank, featuring epic courtyards and stunning paintings.Read more\nPondicherryBlossoming bougainvilleas, crumbling cathedrals on leafy boulevards and 18th-century colonial buildings colour the former French colony of Pondy, which sits on the Bay of Bengal. But it's also unmistakably Indian, with colourful festivals throughout the year, several mosques and the Sri Aurobindo Ashram. Quiet beaches stretch north and south from town, good for swimming and sunrise strolls. Pondy is a popular weekend getaway destination from Chennai and is easy to navigate on foot or by bicycle.Read more\nMumbaiMumbai (formerly known as Bombay), India, is famous for its chaotic streets. For bargains and people-watching, outdoor bazaars top the list of attractions. Popular waterfront destinations are Marine Drive, where visitors go to watch the sun set over the Arabian Sea, and the carnival-like Juhu Beach. More sightseeing options are the Gandhi Museum, in the leader's former home, and the cave temples of Elephanta Island. For tranquillity, Mumbai has many religious sites, lakes and parks.Read more\nOoty (Udhagamandalam)Popularly referred to as Ooty, this gem among southern hill resorts is covered in eucalyptus and pine trees and coffee and tea plantations. On a clear day, it's possible to see as far as the Mysore plateau from Dodabetta Peak, the district's most prominent viewpoint. The Stone House, a landmark 1822 bungalow, and St. Stephen's Church are remnants of the area's first British settlement. Also noteworthy: formal botanical gardens, a children's mini-garden and a contemporary art collection.Read more\nGoaEast meets West in this sun-soaked state, where Indian culture intertwines with Portuguese influences left over from a 500-year occupation. The beaches have long served as a magnet for serene hedonists. To the north, the tourist-centric scene is prevalent, with an international flair that is now skewing more hip than hippie. Travel south for stretches of unspoiled sand and an escape from large resorts. Temples, mosques and wildlife sanctuaries provide diversions from the beach.Read more\nPrayagrajRead more\nDowntown Hotels\nHotels with Kitchenette\nHotels with Free Breakfast\nHotels with Shuttle\nBoutique Hotels\nHistoric Hotels\nUnique Hotels\nHotels with Breakfast Buffet\nHotels with Smoking Rooms\nHoneymoon Hotels\n\n\nMAIN CONTENT:\nAsiaJapanKinkiKyoto PrefectureKyotoKyoto HotelsBudget Hotels in Kyoto{\"@context\":\"http:\\u002F\\u002Fschema.org\",\"@type\":\"BreadcrumbList\",\"itemListElement\":[{\"@type\":\"ListItem\",\"position\":\"1\",\"item\":\"https:\\u002F\\u002Fwww.tripadvisor.in\\u002FTourism-g2-Asia-Vacations.html\",\"name\":\"Asia\"},{\"@type\":\"ListItem\",\"position\":\"2\",\"item\":\"https:\\u002F\\u002Fwww.tripadvisor.in\\u002FTourism-g294232-Japan-Vacations.html\",\"name\":\"Japan\"},{\"@type\":\"ListItem\",\"position\":\"3\",\"item\":\"https:\\u002F\\u002Fwww.tripadvisor.in\\u002FTourism-g298189-Kinki-Vacations.html\",\"name\":\"Kinki\"},{\"@type\":\"ListItem\",\"position\":\"4\",\"item\":\"https:\\u002F\\u002Fwww.tripadvisor.in\\u002FTourism-g298563-Kyoto_Prefecture_Kinki-Vacations.html\",\"name\":\"Kyoto Prefecture\"},{\"@type\":\"ListItem\",\"position\":\"5\",\"item\":\"https:\\u002F\\u002Fwww.tripadvisor.in\\u002FTourism-g298564-Kyoto_Kyoto_Prefecture_Kinki-Vacations.html\",\"name\":\"Kyoto\"},{\"@type\":\"ListItem\",\"position\":\"6\",\"item\":\"https:\\u002F\\u002Fwww.tripadvisor.in\\u002FHotels-g298564-Kyoto_Kyoto_Prefecture_Kinki-Hotels.html\",\"name\":\"Kyoto Hotels\"},{\"@type\":\"ListItem\",\"position\":\"7\",\"name\":\"Budget Hotels in Kyoto\"}]}THE 10 BEST Cheap Hotels in Kyoto 2025{\"@context\":\"http:\\u002F\\u002Fschema.org\",\"@type\":\"FAQPage\",\"mainEntity\":[{\"@type\":\"Question\",\"name\":\"What are the best cheap hotels near Kiyomizu-dera Temple?\",\"acceptedAnswer\":{\"@type\":\"Answer\",\"text\":\"\\u003Cdiv class='faqItem'\\u003E\\u003Cdiv class='answer'\\u003ESome of the more popular cheap hotels near Kiyomizu-dera Temple include:\\u003C\\u002Fdiv\\u003E\\u003Cdiv class='hotels'\\u003E\\u003Ca href='\\u002FHotel_Review-g298564-d1547516-Reviews-Mume-Kyoto_Kyoto_Prefecture_Kinki.html'\\u003EMume\\u003C\\u002Fa\\u003E\\u003Cspan class='description'\\u003E -

In 2010, festivities are in the works to celebrate this ancient city's anniversary. \"Old Japan\" is still easy to spot here, from Great Buddha Hall to traditional ryokans and the serene Isuien garden. travellers rave about walking tours of Nara, particularly in the historic Naramachi merchant area.Read moreHigashiomiRead moreOsakaHome to nearly nine million and powering an economy that exceeds both Hong Kong's and Thailand's, Osaka packs quite a punch.

(Just make sure you heed the local laws‚Äîsomething like spitting in the street might merely be considered rude in your hometown, but here, it carries a severe penalty.) You'll find historic sites like the Thian Hock Keng temple, superlative shopping (including gargantuan malls) and numerous beaches.Read moreVaranasiThe north Indian city of Varanasi, or Benares, is regarded as sacred by Hindus, Buddhists and Jains. Situated in the fertile Ganga valley and on the banks of the Ganges, Varanasi is a place of pilgrimage for Hindus, who come to bathe in the holy river. Known as the City of Temples and a beacon of culture, Varanasi has produced many renowned writers. It‚Äôs also a centre of silk weaving, so practise haggling at the chaotic bazaar for some beautiful souvenirs. Rickshaws are the best way to get about.Read moreNew DelhiLaid out by British architect Edwin Lutyens, the Indian capital is a striking modern metropolis. A gracious contrast to Old Delhi's winding streets, the grand avenues and stately buildings of New Delhi are rich with history and culture, from Gandhi's Delhi home (and the site of his assassination) to the tomb of Humayun, a complex of Mughal buildings reminiscent of the Taj Mahal. Chaotic traffic is best left to the locals. Negotiate a good price for taxis or travel on the new Delhi Metro.Read moreUdaipurUdaipur, known as the Venice of the East, boasts several sparkling lakes against a backdrop of the Aravail hills. Jag Niwas and Jag Mandir, islands in Fateh Sagar Lake, are the site of Udaipur Solar Observatory and Nehru Garden. Famous palaces include the magical Lake Palace, now a luxurious five-star hotel, and the massive City Palace on Pichola‚Äôs east bank, featuring epic courtyards and stunning paintings.Read morePondicherryBlossoming bougainvilleas, crumbling cathedrals on leafy boulevards and 18th-century colonial buildings colour the former French colony of Pondy, which sits on the Bay of Bengal. But it's also unmistakably Indian, with colourful festivals throughout the year, several mosques and the Sri Aurobindo Ashram. Quiet beaches stretch north and south from town, good for swimming and sunrise strolls. Pondy is a popular weekend getaway destination from Chennai and is easy to navigate on foot or by bicycle.Read moreMumbaiMumbai (formerly known as Bombay), India, is famous for its chaotic streets. For bargains and people-watching, outdoor bazaars top the list of attractions. Popular waterfront destinations are Marine Drive, where visitors go to watch the sun set over the Arabian Sea, and the carnival-like Juhu Beach. More sightseeing options are the Gandhi Museum, in the leader's former home, and the cave temples of Elephanta Island. For tranquillity, Mumbai has many religious sites, lakes and parks.Read moreOoty (Udhagamandalam)Popularly referred to as Ooty, this gem among southern hill resorts is covered in eucalyptus and pine trees and coffee and tea plantations. On a clear day, it's possible to see as far as the Mysore plateau from Dodabetta Peak, the district's most prominent viewpoint. The Stone House, a landmark 1822 bungalow, and St. Stephen's Church are remnants of the area's first British settlement. Also noteworthy: formal botanical gardens, a children's mini-garden and a contemporary art collection.Read moreGoaEast meets West in this sun-soaked state, where Indian culture intertwines with Portuguese influences left over from a 500-year occupation. The beaches have long served as a magnet for serene hedonists. To the north, the tourist-centric scene is prevalent, with an international flair that is now skewing more hip than hippie. Travel south for stretches of unspoiled sand and an escape from large resorts. Temples, mosques and wildlife sanctuaries provide diversions from the beach.Read morePrayagrajRead more[{\"@context\":\"http:\\u002F\\u002Fschema.org\",\"@type\":\"LocalBusiness\",\"name\":\"Singapore\",\"description\":\"\",\"url\":\"\",\"image\":\"https:\\u002F\\u002Fdynamic-media-cdn.tripadvisor.com\\u002Fmedia\\u002Fphoto-o\\u002F15\\u002F33\\u002Ffc\\u002Fb1\\u002Fsingapore.jpg?w=600&h=400&s=1\",\"address\":{\"@type\":\"PostalAddress\",\"addressCountry\":\"\",\"addressLocality\":\"\",\"addressRegion\":\"\",\"postalCode\":\"\",\"streetAddress\":\"\"}},{\"@context\":\"http:\\u002F\\u002Fschema.org\",\"@type\":\"LocalBusiness\",\"name\":\"Varanasi\",\"description\":\"\",\"url\":\"\",\"image\":\"https:\\u002F\\u002Fdynamic-media-cdn.tripadvisor.com\\u002Fmedia\\u002Fphoto-o\\u002F0a\\u002Fbe\\u002F17\\u002F41\\u002Fcaption.jpg?w=600&h=400&s=1\",\"address\":{\"@type\":\"PostalAddress\",\"addressCountry\":\"\",\"addressLocality\":\"\",\"addressRegion\":\"\",\"postalCode\":\"\",\"streetAddress\":\"\"}},{\"@context\":\"http:\\u002F\\u002Fschema.org\",\"@type\":\"LocalBusiness\",\"name\":\"New Delhi\",\"description\":\"\",\"url\":\"\",\"image\":\"https:\\u002F\\u002Fdynamic-media-cdn.tripadvisor.com\\u002Fmedia\\u002Fphoto-o\\u002F24\\u002F03\\u002F3f\\u002Ffd\\u002Fcaption.jpg?w=600&h=400&s=1&cx=2294&cy=1952&chk=v1_c3b28b866491ff3722ce\",\"address\":{\"@type\":\"PostalAddress\",\"addressCountry\":\"\",\"addressLocality\":\"\",\"addressRegion\":\"\",\"postalCode\":\"\",\"streetAddress\":\"\"}},{\"@context\":\"http:\\u002F\\u002Fschema.org\",\"@type\":\"LocalBusiness\",\"name\":\"Udaipur\",\"description\":\"\",\"url\":\"\",\"image\":\"https:\\u002F\\u002Fdynamic-media-cdn.tripadvisor.com\\u002Fmedia\\u002Fphoto-o\\u002F01\\u002Fd3\\u002F67\\u002Fe4\\u002Fsas-bahu.jpg?w=600&h=400&s=1\",\"address\":{\"@type\":\"PostalAddress\",\"addressCountry\":\"\",\"addressLocality\":\"\",\"addressRegion\":\"\",\"postalCode\":\"\",\"streetAddress\":\"\"}},{\"@context\":\"http:\\u002F\\u002Fschema.org\",\"@type\":\"LocalBusiness\",\"name\":\"Pondicherry\",\"description\":\"\",\"url\":\"\",\"image\":\"https:\\u002F\\u002Fdynamic-media-cdn.tripadvisor.com\\u002Fmedia\\u002Fphoto-o\\u002F11\\u002Ff4\\u002F3b\\u002F43\\u002Fboating.jpg?w=600&h=400&s=1\",\"address\":{\"@type\":\"PostalAddress\",\"addressCountry\":\"\",\"addressLocality\":\"\",\"addressRegion\":\"\",\"postalCode\":\"\",\"streetAddress\":\"\"}},{\"@context\":\"http:\\u002F\\u002Fschema.org\",\"@type\":\"LocalBusiness\",\"name\":\"Mumbai\",\"description\":\"\",\"url\":\"\",\"image\":\"https:\\u002F\\u002Fdynamic-media-cdn.tripadvisor.com\\u002Fmedia\\u002Fphoto-o\\u002F0b\\u002F4e\\u002F55\\u002Fe6\\u002Fchhatrapati-shivaji-terminus.jpg?w=600&h=400&s=1\",\"address\":{\"@type\":\"PostalAddress\",\"addressCountry\":\"\",\"addressLocality\":\"\",\"addressRegion\":\"\",\"postalCode\":\"\",\"streetAddress\":\"\"}},{\"@context\":\"http:\\u002F\\u002Fschema.org\",\"@type\":\"LocalBusiness\",\"name\":\"Ooty (Udhagamandalam)\",\"description\":\"\",\"url\":\"\",\"image\":\"https:\\u002F\\u002Fdynamic-media-cdn.tripadvisor.com\\u002Fmedia\\u002Fphoto-o\\u002F0a\\u002F84\\u002F3c\\u002Fbc\\u002Fupper-bhavani-lake.jpg?w=600&h=400&s=1\",\"address\":{\"@type\":\"PostalAddress\",\"addressCountry\":\"\",\"addressLocality\":\"\",\"addressRegion\":\"\",\"postalCode\":\"\",\"streetAddress\":\"\"}},{\"@context\":\"http:\\u002F\\u002Fschema.org\",\"@type\":\"LocalBusiness\",\"name\":\"Goa\",\"description\":\"\",\"url\":\"\",\"image\":\"https:\\u002F\\u002Fdynamic-media-cdn.tripadvisor.com\\u002Fmedia\\u002Fphoto-o\\u002F15\\u002F33\\u002Ffc\\u002Ff0\\u002Fgoa.jpg?w=600&h=400&s=1\",\"address\":{\"@type\":\"PostalAddress\",\"addressCountry\":\"\",\"addressLocality\":\"\",\"addressRegion\":\"\",\"postalCode\":\"\",\"streetAddress\":\"\"}},{\"@context\":\"http:\\u002F\\u002Fschema.org\",\"@type\":\"LocalBusiness\",\"name\":\"Prayagraj\",\"description\":\"\",\"url\":\"\",\"image\":\"https:\\u002F\\u002Fdynamic-media-cdn.tripadvisor.com\\u002Fmedia\\u002Fphoto-o\\u002F0f\\u002Fae\\u002Fb4\\u002F68\\u002Ffort-on-the-side.jpg?w=600&h=400&s=1\",\"address\":{\"@type\":\"PostalAddress\",\"addressCountry\":\"\",\"addressLocality\":\"\",\"addressRegion\":\"\",\"postalCode\":\"\",\"streetAddress\":\"\"}}]Popular Kyoto CategoriesDowntown HotelsHotels with KitchenetteHotels with Free BreakfastHotels with ShuttleBoutique HotelsHistoric HotelsUnique HotelsHotels with Breakfast BuffetHotels with Smoking RoomsHoneymoon HotelsCheap Hotels informationCheap Hotels Kyoto32Cheap Hotels Prices From‚Çπ3,472Cheap Hotels Reviews18,500Cheap Hotels Photos14,767Frequently Asked Questions about cheap hotelsWhat are the best cheap hotels near Kiyomizu-dera Temple?Some of the more popular cheap hotels near Kiyomizu-dera Temple include:Mume -

A coin laundry is located next door, but there is a cheaper one just around the corner.\nThere are a microwave and some kitchen tools in the lobby.Guest review byAssafSolo traveler\nShizutetsu Hotel Prezio Kyoto ShijoCheap hotel in KyotoAvg. price/night: ‚Çπ¬†21,759.85Review score9.0 Wonderful¬†¬∑¬†951 reviewsThe size and comfort of my room felt like luxury to me after spending a week in a cheaper hotel beforehand.

Good location and spotless clean friendly, English speaking staffGuest review byBenedettaYoung couple\nRAK KIYOMIZU - 1‰∫∫ÊóÖÂ∞ÇÁî®hostelCheap hotel in KyotoReview score8.2 Very Good¬†¬∑¬†772 reviewsOnce you are checked in you can do as you please, if you want to be in all day or out it is up to you. It has a great location close to all the main attractions so you can be there early to beat the crowds, even before the transportation starts working as you can go by foot. It was very clean and the staff were really nice. Plus the bonus is that you get the WHOLE ROOM to yourself for cheaper than a capsule hotel. \nWhen I return to Japan I will most definitely book this stay again.Guest review byNezkaSolo traveler\nM's Hotel Kyoto Station TaruyaCheap hotel in KyotoAvg. price/night: ‚Çπ¬†18,896.71Review score7.7 Good¬†¬∑¬†1,934 reviewsSpacious comfortable room.
