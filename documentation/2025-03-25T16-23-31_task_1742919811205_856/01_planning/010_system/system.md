  "feedback": "The step to book accommodation and transportation was partially executed. The browser agent successfully navigated to relevant websites for booking bus tickets to New York City, such as FlixBus and Greyhound. However, there was an issue with accessing the Expedia site for hotel bookings, as it required additional verification to confirm human interaction. The Booking.com site was accessed successfully, providing options for hotel bookings.",
