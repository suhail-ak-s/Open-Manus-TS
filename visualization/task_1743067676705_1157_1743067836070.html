Where to propose in Japan\nIntro\n\nForget Paris, Japan is the new capital of romance. This achingly beautiful country is the perfect place to pop the question and is infinitely more original than more traditional proposal destinations. Japan is alternative, hip, and will look sensational in photographs when you share your happy news with family and friends. You could even return for the wedding and honeymoon!

Similarly, if you’re getting down on one knee in a very popular public place, timing is everything. You definitely don’t want somewhere too busy or overcrowded so it’s worth considering the best time of day (and even the best time of year) to avoid the crowds. The likes of Cherry Blossom season (late March/early April) for instance, while undoubtedly beautiful and very romantic, is also the single busiest time of year with millions of extra visitors to Japan. The first few days of New Year’s Day are also very busy as Japanese people visit temples and shrines across the country. Golden Week – Japan’s week of national holidays – is another time when the country may seem busier than usual as many residents will be off work. And of course, in 2020, there’s also the small matter of the Olympics too – although if you and your partner are sports fans then maybe this would be the perfect time to propose?! Find out everything you need to know in our dedicated Tokyo 2020 and the JR Pass guide.  As a result, you might want to look ...\n\nObserved output of cmd `browser` executed:\nSuccessfully navigated to https://www.theknot.com/content/japan-proposal-ideas\n\nPage Title: Plan a Japan Marriage Proposal | Best Places to Propose in Japan\n\nPAGE CONTENT:\n12 Spots for the Perfect Japan Marriage Proposal\nFrom Hokkaido down to Okinawa, here are the best places to propose in Japan.\nPhoto: chanchai duangdoosan | Shutterstock\nby Brittany Barber\nUpdated Oct 18, 2024\n\nAre you planning a Japan marriage proposal?

Similarly, if you’re getting down on one knee in a very popular public place, timing is everything. You definitely don’t want somewhere too busy or overcrowded so it’s worth considering the best time of day (and even the best time of year) to avoid the crowds. The likes of Cherry Blossom season (late March/early April) for instance, while undoubtedly beautiful and very romantic, is also the single busiest time of year with millions of extra visitors to Japan. The first few days of New Year’s Day are also very busy as Japanese people visit temples and shrines across the country. Golden Week – Japan’s week of national holidays – is another time when the country may seem busier than usual as many residents will be off work. And of course, in 2020, there’s also the small matter of the Olympics too – although if you and your partner are sports fans then maybe this would be the perfect time to propose?!

Where to propose in Japan\nIntro\n\nForget Paris, Japan is the new capital of romance. This achingly beautiful country is the perfect place to pop the question and is infinitely more original than more traditional proposal destinations.

Similarly, if you’re getting down on one knee in a very popular public place, timing is everything. You definitely don’t want somewhere too busy or overcrowded so it’s worth considering the best time of day (and even the best time of year) to avoid the crowds. The likes of Cherry Blossom season (late March/early April) for instance, while undoubtedly beautiful and very romantic, is also the single busiest time of year with millions of extra visitors to Japan. The first few days of New Year’s Day are also very busy as Japanese people visit temples and shrines across the country. Golden Week – Japan’s week of national holidays – is another time when the country may seem busier than usual as many residents will be off work. And of course, in 2020, there’s also the small matter of the Olympics too – although if you and your partner are sports fans then maybe this would be the perfect time to propose?!

The likes of Cherry Blossom season (late March/early April) for instance, while undoubtedly beautiful and very romantic, is also the single busiest time of year with millions of extra visitors to Japan. The first few days of New Year’s Day are also very busy as Japanese people visit temples and shrines across the country. Golden Week – Japan’s week of national holidays – is another time when the country may seem busier than usual as many residents will be off work. And of course, in 2020, there’s also the small matter of the Olympics too – although if you and your partner are sports fans then maybe this would be the perfect time to propose?!
