Once at gate when time to board, had to take standing room bus to the tarmac to board. Did not like getting out to plane and having to wait 5 minutes until they opened bus door.\nFirst experience with JAL so was okay to pretty good. 10 hour flight in premium select seat. . Seats in that category should be better than pretty good. Seat pan a little short for tall people but plenty of leg room; I think JAL in process of new planes? Also, — they could have offered a bit more water throughout flight and meals not the greatest. That said, certainly 200 percent better than a very recent AK Air International flight in similar cabin class in comfort and meals.\nIt's a domestic flight, but still the JAL quality shone through. The crew were polite and helpful and even prepared little gifts / souvenirs for the children on the flight, and everyone got a simple drink. The free wifi for entertainment on the personal device was also a great boon, and the shows surprisingly decent. Would recommend.\nWe ordered for non vegetarian Hindu meal but instead they served us vegetarian Hindu meal. That was also not good. It was very annoying and aggravating. Hope our return from Tokyo to jfk on March 27 same is not repeated. Caterar should understand difference between non vegetarian Hindu meal and vegetarian Hindu meal.\nAllow gold card holders (Group 1) to board with their guest like other One World carriers do\nChecked baggage process is confusing and time consuming especially when checking oversized bags. Very slow agents didn't help.\nFood was great, Entertainment was bad, movies were not current and just did not have good variety. Granted I was tired so cranky might have played into my evaluation. Overall based on cost I definitely would fly them again. I am a million mile flyer on another airline, the service on JAL really beats all airlines.\nThe team members are extremely attentive to make sure you have the best experience.\nWas in premium economy. It is slightly better than economy, but the way the seat reclines actually makes it harder to sit (the seat slides forward and the foot rest comes up - you can lie fairly well reclined but you’ll have to sit cross legged because there is no place for your legs to stretch out. Food is basic economy. Service was great. All in all good, but may make more sense to pay more for business or save a bit and just sit in economy.\nSeats in \"Premium Economy\" were noticeably more comfortable than those in \"Economy\" and worth the price. My only reservation is that the foot rest did not go higher up. If it did, it would have made the seat much more comfortable.\nThis was the best airline I’ve ever taken. The staff are amazing. The food was great. The pilot was phenomenal. I would highly recommend this airline.\nThere wasn't much entertainment for my short flight but the onboarding process was smooth and the crew provided wonderful service. The seats were also reasonably comfy. Great flight.\nI had to get rerouted because the weather delayed my flight enough to miss both of my connecting flights. I select nearly 2 hours on customer service trying to get rerouted and had to miss my first plane which took my luggage to San Francisco. Luckily, customer service sent me to the same airport but I had to ride 12 hours in economy after I paid extra for premium economy. Totally sucks that I overpaid. Customer service and airplane crew were great and really helpful though. Although I still hate how small the seat was, especially since I'm smaller than average, I can't imagine how much it would suck for an average sized person.\nCabin crew were excellent in taking care of my mom as she boarded the aircraft from her wheelchair. Did not care much for the food served.\nI stopped flying with United back in the nineties. Today's experience reminded me of why.\nGreat airline all together - triple 7 for a short flight was a plus - lots of room\nWonderfully pleasant experience. Good meal and beverage selections. Professional air staff.\nSeat width can be a bit wider. not nice that they charge extra for the window seats. online check in can be greatly improved. in other words, their online interface is bad.\nSeat width can be a bit wider. not nice that they charge extra for the window seats.\nSeats were comfortable with excellent legroom.

And I have flown on many.\nNot great, will likely try to fly another or maybe I should have upgraded my ticket? Needed Air…\nI don’t think I’ll be flying them again. Tight seats, no flowing air or air nozzles that you can turn air on you, for those who could have motion sickness this would be your worst nightmare. The pilot was great and experienced (which is what you want when flying 12 hours) overall I’m thankful knowledgeable pilots!\nMy ticket did not indication which group I was in for boarding; the gate attended help me\nVery routh cabin crew food is only 2 meals for 13 hours fry with them They should get better training how to service good super routh language and talking with customer\nstaff are super nice and effiecient! It was a very comfortable and relaxing flight\nBoarding could have been a little bit better but other than that it was a pretty good experience. I think because of the stowaway to Paris France recently they are being extra diligent about boarding passes at the gate. But they boarded the back of the plane first, and that's something I really think needs to start in the USA.\nI was ordered vegetarian food, but didn't services to me :(\nI did not take the flight, tried to cancel it right after I booked it, but was unable to reach anyone. I blame Kayak for this situation because they sent the booking through another company and I was unable to get anyone to talk to me about the situation. I had to just take the hit and pay for another flight through Cathay Pacific, which was wonderful. I will never use Kayak again. (I bet they don’t post this review!) I’ll just post about them on social media sites. I don’t want anyone to have to go through the hassle and expense I dealt with.\nAirline itself is great. While food was being taken off of my tray my beer spilled which was a total accident and I wasn’t upset about that, what was frustrating was I had to ask for towels to clean up and wipe my leg. It would have been left as is if I hadn’t.\nThe seats felt very small. We were supplied with pillows and blankets, which was nice. Lots of noise from the bathroom, plus exterior noise. Made it hard to hear the entertainment system, even using my own noise-cancelling headphones. The food was really bad. I generally request a vegetarian meal and one was supplied, but the pasta was cold and hard and there was nothing pleasant about it. Two meals were served on this flight; one was a repeat of the meal I had had on the flight immediately preceding this one, which was bad enough I didn't even try it. Drinks were very limited. All I wanted was water, and on a 10.5 hour flight, I was given 3 cups of about 3 ounces each.\nThe seats felt very small. We were supplied with pillows and blankets, which was nice.

I generally request a vegetarian meal and one was supplied, but the pasta was cold and hard and there was nothing pleasant about it. Drinks were very limited. All I wanted was water, and on a 4 hour flight, I was given 2 cups of about 3 ounces each.\nEverything was perfect. A flight attendant even brought me snacks after I declined food due to my desire to force myself to follow the destination time zone.\nFor the most part, it was an enjoyable experience. It's the 2nd half of the journey was a bit uncomfortable. It was on a noticable smaller plane compared to the previous one.\nOnly process that my luggage didn’t make it to my destination because of short connection but I understand\nThe boarding process was good. The toilet could be better maintained.\nThis has been the worst experience I've ever had. We arrived to Ho Chi Minh Airport and were supposed to get our Asiana ticket from the transfer counter as we came with a different airline. However, the staff at the transfer counter were not helpful and kept giving us different information. We were first told by Asiana airlines staff we had to wait 2 hours so they could print out and give us our tickets, then someone else told us we had to wait 3hrs, someone told us \"I don't know, just go sit and wait and we will tell you later.\" This was at a place in the Ho Chi Minh airport that had no coffee or food shops, nothing, just immigration (to enter Vietnam with a Vietnam Visa) and security (to transfer into the gates) but we needed our printed boarding pass to go through. It wasn't until we demanded to speak to a supervisor as our flight time was 1hr away because they kept telling us \"there's alot of time left for your international flight, we will get your tickets later\" we still had to wait around 20minutes for the \"Supervisor\" to give us our tickets. I would NOT recommend Asiana Airlines, especially if going thru Ho Chi Minh Airport as they are not helpful. (We almost missed our flight, due to their lazyness and incompetence of printing our tickets) I would suggest Asiana Airlines to have a Machine in the transfer area so passengers can easily print out their boarding passes themselves and save some money by not hiring incompetent staff that can't do a simple task such as printing a boarding pass.\nGreat service. They could offer vegetarian food and do more to reduce waste.\nI like the food, the crew and everything.!!! Except for the delay in our flight.\nGreat service and comfortable seats. The first meal was excellent but the second meal was only satisfactory\nEverything went smoothly. I appreciate the selection of free movies.\nI like the friendliness of the crew members. I think the snack could’ve been better instead of a small package of pretzel. I like that they offer me something to drink.\nThe TSA agents in Phoenix were incredibly rude and confiscated belongings that we wanted to check. The flight got changed without our knowledge to a worse situation. The whole thing was terrible\nAir Canada was great! From the airport at Montreal to boarding to the food on board the plane. The crew was great too! There was a slight issue with some other peoples’ tickets that I overheard about but the crew handled with care immediately to ensure everyone was comfortable and we could takeoff! Great experience with Air Canada\nMy experience with Air Canada was good. Great customer service… only a few delays and issues with the tunnel to exit the plain. I did not appreciate that we arrived at terminal D and had to go to terminal E to get the bags/ luggage.\nPDX staff was great and we arrived on time in YVR.\nThey announced before boarding that the flight was full and there would be limited space in the overhead bins and you could check in for free. We did and after we boarded the plane found it was not full and there was plenty of space in the overhead bins. I’m not sure why they made this announcement.\nFront desk attendant wouldn’t check me in even though there was not a single person in line. Made me use the kiosk. Kiosk had an error (of course) no baggage can be checked at this kiosk please see attendant. Then I had to wait in line for the same front desk attendant waiting for 5 people who ended up coming in front of me while I tried to use a broken and useless kiosk. Finally after checked in, wait 30 min to board all the way to zone 6 and they would deny me even after all the zone 1-5 people already went. Just literally making us wait to board so they stand there doing nothing for 5 minutes. Just ridiculous and awful customer service. Fly with literally anyone else\nThey are a great airline, and i enjoying flying with them. However my experience with booking through Kayak was a horrible experience. With all the restrictions and glitches of website. My entire bookings by kayak was wrong. And there was no possible way of fixing anything with them, because they hand over responsibility to the airline after purchase is made. Will not be booking through Kayak again and will inform my family and friends not to as well.\nAll was good with comfort and ease of boarding. There was confusion from what gate to board at. Meant moving a long distance but I allowed plenty of time for this.\nNot what you’re looking for?

Top city attractions include the aquarium, Osaka Castle, Universal Studios Japan and the futuristic Floating Garden Observatory.Read more\nTakashimaRead more\nHashimotoRead more\nNagoyaCommerce keeps Nagoya’s downtown popping with life, but there’s more than just manufacturing to this industrial powerhouse. Nagoyans meet for plates of crisp-friend miso katsu; make weekend trips to nearby Shinto shrines; and count down the days to the city’s autumn Nagoya Festival.Read more\nKainanRead more\nAwaji-shimaRead more\nSingaporeSingapore is known as a bustling metropolis that also happens to be one of the cleanest and safest cities of its size in the world. (Just make sure you heed the local laws—something like spitting in the street might merely be considered rude in your hometown, but here, it carries a severe penalty.) You'll find historic sites like the Thian Hock Keng temple, superlative shopping (including gargantuan malls) and numerous beaches.Read more\nVaranasiThe north Indian city of Varanasi, or Benares, is regarded as sacred by Hindus, Buddhists and Jains. Situated in the fertile Ganga valley and on the banks of the Ganges, Varanasi is a place of pilgrimage for Hindus, who come to bathe in the holy river. Known as the City of Temples and a beacon of culture, Varanasi has produced many renowned writers. It’s also a centre of silk weaving, so practise haggling at the chaotic bazaar for some beautiful souvenirs. Rickshaws are the best way to get about.Read more\nNew DelhiLaid out by British architect Edwin Lutyens, the Indian capital is a striking modern metropolis. A gracious contrast to Old Delhi's winding streets, the grand avenues and stately buildings of New Delhi are rich with history and culture, from Gandhi's Delhi home (and the site of his assassination) to the tomb of Humayun, a complex of Mughal buildings reminiscent of the Taj Mahal. Chaotic traffic is best left to the locals. Negotiate a good price for taxis or travel on the new Delhi Metro.Read more\nUdaipurUdaipur, known as the Venice of the East, boasts several sparkling lakes against a backdrop of the Aravail hills. Jag Niwas and Jag Mandir, islands in Fateh Sagar Lake, are the site of Udaipur Solar Observatory and Nehru Garden. Famous palaces include the magical Lake Palace, now a luxurious five-star hotel, and the massive City Palace on Pichola’s east bank, featuring epic courtyards and stunning paintings.Read more\nPondicherryBlossoming bougainvilleas, crumbling cathedrals on leafy boulevards and 18th-century colonial buildings colour the former French colony of Pondy, which sits on the Bay of Bengal. But it's also unmistakably Indian, with colourful festivals throughout the year, several mosques and the Sri Aurobindo Ashram. Quiet beaches stretch north and south from town, good for swimming and sunrise strolls. Pondy is a popular weekend getaway destination from Chennai and is easy to navigate on foot or by bicycle.Read more\nMumbaiMumbai (formerly known as Bombay), India, is famous for its chaotic streets. For bargains and people-watching, outdoor bazaars top the list of attractions. Popular waterfront destinations are Marine Drive, where visitors go to watch the sun set over the Arabian Sea, and the carnival-like Juhu Beach. More sightseeing options are the Gandhi Museum, in the leader's former home, and the cave temples of Elephanta Island. For tranquillity, Mumbai has many religious sites, lakes and parks.Read more\nOoty (Udhagamandalam)Popularly referred to as Ooty, this gem among southern hill resorts is covered in eucalyptus and pine trees and coffee and tea plantations. On a clear day, it's possible to see as far as the Mysore plateau from Dodabetta Peak, the district's most prominent viewpoint. The Stone House, a landmark 1822 bungalow, and St. Stephen's Church are remnants of the area's first British settlement. Also noteworthy: formal botanical gardens, a children's mini-garden and a contemporary art collection.Read more\nGoaEast meets West in this sun-soaked state, where Indian culture intertwines with Portuguese influences left over from a 500-year occupation. The beaches have long served as a magnet for serene hedonists. To the north, the tourist-centric scene is prevalent, with an international flair that is now skewing more hip than hippie. Travel south for stretches of unspoiled sand and an escape from large resorts. Temples, mosques and wildlife sanctuaries provide diversions from the beach.Read more\nPrayagrajRead more\nDowntown Hotels\nHotels with Kitchenette\nHotels with Free Breakfast\nHotels with Shuttle\nBoutique Hotels\nHistoric Hotels\nUnique Hotels\nHotels with Breakfast Buffet\nHotels with Smoking Rooms\nHoneymoon Hotels\n\n\nMAIN CONTENT:\nAsiaJapanKinkiKyoto PrefectureKyotoKyoto HotelsBudget Hotels in Kyoto{\"@context\":\"http:\\u002F\\u002Fschema.org\",\"@type\":\"BreadcrumbList\",\"itemListElement\":[{\"@type\":\"ListItem\",\"position\":\"1\",\"item\":\"https:\\u002F\\u002Fwww.tripadvisor.in\\u002FTourism-g2-Asia-Vacations.html\",\"name\":\"Asia\"},{\"@type\":\"ListItem\",\"position\":\"2\",\"item\":\"https:\\u002F\\u002Fwww.tripadvisor.in\\u002FTourism-g294232-Japan-Vacations.html\",\"name\":\"Japan\"},{\"@type\":\"ListItem\",\"position\":\"3\",\"item\":\"https:\\u002F\\u002Fwww.tripadvisor.in\\u002FTourism-g298189-Kinki-Vacations.html\",\"name\":\"Kinki\"},{\"@type\":\"ListItem\",\"position\":\"4\",\"item\":\"https:\\u002F\\u002Fwww.tripadvisor.in\\u002FTourism-g298563-Kyoto_Prefecture_Kinki-Vacations.html\",\"name\":\"Kyoto Prefecture\"},{\"@type\":\"ListItem\",\"position\":\"5\",\"item\":\"https:\\u002F\\u002Fwww.tripadvisor.in\\u002FTourism-g298564-Kyoto_Kyoto_Prefecture_Kinki-Vacations.html\",\"name\":\"Kyoto\"},{\"@type\":\"ListItem\",\"position\":\"6\",\"item\":\"https:\\u002F\\u002Fwww.tripadvisor.in\\u002FHotels-g298564-Kyoto_Kyoto_Prefecture_Kinki-Hotels.html\",\"name\":\"Kyoto Hotels\"},{\"@type\":\"ListItem\",\"position\":\"7\",\"name\":\"Budget Hotels in Kyoto\"}]}THE 10 BEST Cheap Hotels in Kyoto 2025{\"@context\":\"http:\\u002F\\u002Fschema.org\",\"@type\":\"FAQPage\",\"mainEntity\":[{\"@type\":\"Question\",\"name\":\"What are the best cheap hotels near Kiyomizu-dera Temple?\",\"acceptedAnswer\":{\"@type\":\"Answer\",\"text\":\"\\u003Cdiv class='faqItem'\\u003E\\u003Cdiv class='answer'\\u003ESome of the more popular cheap hotels near Kiyomizu-dera Temple include:\\u003C\\u002Fdiv\\u003E\\u003Cdiv class='hotels'\\u003E\\u003Ca href='\\u002FHotel_Review-g298564-d1547516-Reviews-Mume-Kyoto_Kyoto_Prefecture_Kinki.html'\\u003EMume\\u003C\\u002Fa\\u003E\\u003Cspan class='description'\\u003E -

(Just make sure you heed the local laws—something like spitting in the street might merely be considered rude in your hometown, but here, it carries a severe penalty.) You'll find historic sites like the Thian Hock Keng temple, superlative shopping (including gargantuan malls) and numerous beaches.Read moreVaranasiThe north Indian city of Varanasi, or Benares, is regarded as sacred by Hindus, Buddhists and Jains. Situated in the fertile Ganga valley and on the banks of the Ganges, Varanasi is a place of pilgrimage for Hindus, who come to bathe in the holy river. Known as the City of Temples and a beacon of culture, Varanasi has produced many renowned writers. It’s also a centre of silk weaving, so practise haggling at the chaotic bazaar for some beautiful souvenirs. Rickshaws are the best way to get about.Read moreNew DelhiLaid out by British architect Edwin Lutyens, the Indian capital is a striking modern metropolis. A gracious contrast to Old Delhi's winding streets, the grand avenues and stately buildings of New Delhi are rich with history and culture, from Gandhi's Delhi home (and the site of his assassination) to the tomb of Humayun, a complex of Mughal buildings reminiscent of the Taj Mahal. Chaotic traffic is best left to the locals. Negotiate a good price for taxis or travel on the new Delhi Metro.Read moreUdaipurUdaipur, known as the Venice of the East, boasts several sparkling lakes against a backdrop of the Aravail hills. Jag Niwas and Jag Mandir, islands in Fateh Sagar Lake, are the site of Udaipur Solar Observatory and Nehru Garden. Famous palaces include the magical Lake Palace, now a luxurious five-star hotel, and the massive City Palace on Pichola’s east bank, featuring epic courtyards and stunning paintings.Read morePondicherryBlossoming bougainvilleas, crumbling cathedrals on leafy boulevards and 18th-century colonial buildings colour the former French colony of Pondy, which sits on the Bay of Bengal. But it's also unmistakably Indian, with colourful festivals throughout the year, several mosques and the Sri Aurobindo Ashram. Quiet beaches stretch north and south from town, good for swimming and sunrise strolls. Pondy is a popular weekend getaway destination from Chennai and is easy to navigate on foot or by bicycle.Read moreMumbaiMumbai (formerly known as Bombay), India, is famous for its chaotic streets. For bargains and people-watching, outdoor bazaars top the list of attractions. Popular waterfront destinations are Marine Drive, where visitors go to watch the sun set over the Arabian Sea, and the carnival-like Juhu Beach. More sightseeing options are the Gandhi Museum, in the leader's former home, and the cave temples of Elephanta Island. For tranquillity, Mumbai has many religious sites, lakes and parks.Read moreOoty (Udhagamandalam)Popularly referred to as Ooty, this gem among southern hill resorts is covered in eucalyptus and pine trees and coffee and tea plantations. On a clear day, it's possible to see as far as the Mysore plateau from Dodabetta Peak, the district's most prominent viewpoint. The Stone House, a landmark 1822 bungalow, and St. Stephen's Church are remnants of the area's first British settlement. Also noteworthy: formal botanical gardens, a children's mini-garden and a contemporary art collection.Read moreGoaEast meets West in this sun-soaked state, where Indian culture intertwines with Portuguese influences left over from a 500-year occupation. The beaches have long served as a magnet for serene hedonists. To the north, the tourist-centric scene is prevalent, with an international flair that is now skewing more hip than hippie. Travel south for stretches of unspoiled sand and an escape from large resorts.

Once at gate when time to board, had to take standing room bus to the tarmac to board. Did not like getting out to plane and having to wait 5 minutes until they opened bus door.\nThis flight was leg 2 of 2 leg journey. The staff at baggage re-drop in Tokyo were fabulous. Once at gate when time to board, had to take standing room bus to the tarmac to board. Did not like getting out to plane and having to wait 5 minutes until they opened bus door.\nFirst experience with JAL so was okay to pretty good. 10 hour flight in premium select seat. . Seats in that category should be better than pretty good. Seat pan a little short for tall people but plenty of leg room; I think JAL in process of new planes? Also, — they could have offered a bit more water throughout flight and meals not the greatest. That said, certainly 200 percent better than a very recent AK Air International flight in similar cabin class in comfort and meals.\nIt's a domestic flight, but still the JAL quality shone through. The crew were polite and helpful and even prepared little gifts / souvenirs for the children on the flight, and everyone got a simple drink. The free wifi for entertainment on the personal device was also a great boon, and the shows surprisingly decent. Would recommend.\nWe ordered for non vegetarian Hindu meal but instead they served us vegetarian Hindu meal. That was also not good. It was very annoying and aggravating. Hope our return from Tokyo to jfk on March 27 same is not repeated. Caterar should understand difference between non vegetarian Hindu meal and vegetarian Hindu meal.\nAllow gold card holders (Group 1) to board with their guest like other One World carriers do\nChecked baggage process is confusing and time consuming especially when checking oversized bags. Very slow agents didn't help.\nFood was great, Entertainment was bad, movies were not current and just did not have good variety. Granted I was tired so cranky might have played into my evaluation. Overall based on cost I definitely would fly them again. I am a million mile flyer on another airline, the service on JAL really beats all airlines.\nThe team members are extremely attentive to make sure you have the best experience.\nWas in premium economy. It is slightly better than economy, but the way the seat reclines actually makes it harder to sit (the seat slides forward and the foot rest comes up - you can lie fairly well reclined but you’ll have to sit cross legged because there is no place for your legs to stretch out. Food is basic economy. Service was great. All in all good, but may make more sense to pay more for business or save a bit and just sit in economy.\nSeats in \"Premium Economy\" were noticeably more comfortable than those in \"Economy\" and worth the price. My only reservation is that the foot rest did not go higher up. If it did, it would have made the seat much more comfortable.\nThis was the best airline I’ve ever taken. The staff are amazing. The food was great. The pilot was phenomenal. I would highly recommend this airline.\nThere wasn't much entertainment for my short flight but the onboarding process was smooth and the crew provided wonderful service. The seats were also reasonably comfy. Great flight.\nI had to get rerouted because the weather delayed my flight enough to miss both of my connecting flights. I select nearly 2 hours on customer service trying to get rerouted and had to miss my first plane which took my luggage to San Francisco. Luckily, customer service sent me to the same airport but I had to ride 12 hours in economy after I paid extra for premium economy. Totally sucks that I overpaid. Customer service and airplane crew were great and really helpful though. Although I still hate how small the seat was, especially since I'm smaller than average, I can't imagine how much it would suck for an average sized person.\nCabin crew were excellent in taking care of my mom as she boarded the aircraft from her wheelchair. Did not care much for the food served.\nI stopped flying with United back in the nineties. Today's experience reminded me of why.\nGreat airline all together - triple 7 for a short flight was a plus - lots of room\nWonderfully pleasant experience. Good meal and beverage selections. Professional air staff.\nSeat width can be a bit wider. not nice that they charge extra for the window seats. online check in can be greatly improved. in other words, their online interface is bad.\nSeat width can be a bit wider. not nice that they charge extra for the window seats.\nSeats were comfortable with excellent legroom. Meals were also quite good. The cabin crew were excellent and very helpful. The check-in experience was also very smooth.\nMost relaxing long distance flight I have been on. And I have flown on many.\nNot great, will likely try to fly another or maybe I should have upgraded my ticket? Needed Air…\nI don’t think I’ll be flying them again. Tight seats, no flowing air or air nozzles that you can turn air on you, for those who could have motion sickness this would be your worst nightmare. The pilot was great and experienced (which is what you want when flying 12 hours) overall I’m thankful knowledgeable pilots!\nMy ticket did not indication which group I was in for boarding; the gate attended help me\nVery routh cabin crew food is only 2 meals for 13 hours fry with them They should get better training how to service good super routh language and talking with customer\nstaff are super nice and effiecient! It was a very comfortable and relaxing flight\nBoarding could have been a little bit better but other than that it was a pretty good experience. I think because of the stowaway to Paris France recently they are being extra diligent about boarding passes at the gate. But they boarded the back of the plane first, and that's something I really think needs to start in the USA.\nI was ordered vegetarian food, but didn't services to me :(\nI did not take the flight, tried to cancel it right after I booked it, but was unable to reach anyone. I blame Kayak for this situation because they sent the booking through another company and I was unable to get anyone to talk to me about the situation. I had to just take the hit and pay for another flight through Cathay Pacific, which was wonderful. I will never use Kayak again. (I bet they don’t post this review!) I’ll just post about them on social media sites. I don’t want anyone to have to go through the hassle and expense I dealt with.\nAirline itself is great. While food was being taken off of my tray my beer spilled which was a total accident and I wasn’t upset about that, what was frustrating was I had to ask for towels to clean up and wipe my leg. It would have been left as is if I hadn’t.\nThe seats felt very small. We were supplied with pillows and blankets, which was nice. Lots of noise from the bathroom, plus exterior noise. Made it hard to hear the entertainment system, even using my own noise-cancelling headphones. The food was really bad. I generally request a vegetarian meal and one was supplied, but the pasta was cold and hard and there was nothing pleasant about it. Two meals were served on this flight; one was a repeat of the meal I had had on the flight immediately preceding this one, which was bad enough I didn't even try it. Drinks were very limited. All I wanted was water, and on a 10.5 hour flight, I was given 3 cups of about 3 ounces each.\nThe seats felt very small. We were supplied with pillows and blankets, which was nice.

I generally request a vegetarian meal and one was supplied, but the pasta was cold and hard and there was nothing pleasant about it. Drinks were very limited. All I wanted was water, and on a 4 hour flight, I was given 2 cups of about 3 ounces each.\nEverything was perfect. A flight attendant even brought me snacks after I declined food due to my desire to force myself to follow the destination time zone.\nFor the most part, it was an enjoyable experience. It's the 2nd half of the journey was a bit uncomfortable. It was on a noticable smaller plane compared to the previous one.\nOnly process that my luggage didn’t make it to my destination because of short connection but I understand\nThe boarding process was good. The toilet could be better maintained.\nThis has been the worst experience I've ever had. We arrived to Ho Chi Minh Airport and were supposed to get our Asiana ticket from the transfer counter as we came with a different airline. However, the staff at the transfer counter were not helpful and kept giving us different information. We were first told by Asiana airlines staff we had to wait 2 hours so they could print out and give us our tickets, then someone else told us we had to wait 3hrs, someone told us \"I don't know, just go sit and wait and we will tell you later.\" This was at a place in the Ho Chi Minh airport that had no coffee or food shops, nothing, just immigration (to enter Vietnam with a Vietnam Visa) and security (to transfer into the gates) but we needed our printed boarding pass to go through. It wasn't until we demanded to speak to a supervisor as our flight time was 1hr away because they kept telling us \"there's alot of time left for your international flight, we will get your tickets later\" we still had to wait around 20minutes for the \"Supervisor\" to give us our tickets. I would NOT recommend Asiana Airlines, especially if going thru Ho Chi Minh Airport as they are not helpful. (We almost missed our flight, due to their lazyness and incompetence of printing our tickets) I would suggest Asiana Airlines to have a Machine in the transfer area so passengers can easily print out their boarding passes themselves and save some money by not hiring incompetent staff that can't do a simple task such as printing a boarding pass.\nGreat service. They could offer vegetarian food and do more to reduce waste.\nI like the food, the crew and everything.!!! Except for the delay in our flight.\nGreat service and comfortable seats. The first meal was excellent but the second meal was only satisfactory\nEverything went smoothly. I appreciate the selection of free movies.\nI like the friendliness of the crew members. I think the snack could’ve been better instead of a small package of pretzel. I like that they offer me something to drink.\nThe TSA agents in Phoenix were incredibly rude and confiscated belongings that we wanted to check. The flight got changed without our knowledge to a worse situation. The whole thing was terrible\nAir Canada was great! From the airport at Montreal to boarding to the food on board the plane. The crew was great too! There was a slight issue with some other peoples’ tickets that I overheard about but the crew handled with care immediately to ensure everyone was comfortable and we could takeoff! Great experience with Air Canada\nMy experience with Air Canada was good. Great customer service… only a few delays and issues with the tunnel to exit the plain. I did not appreciate that we arrived at terminal D and had to go to terminal E to get the bags/ luggage.\nPDX staff was great and we arrived on time in YVR.\nThey announced before boarding that the flight was full and there would be limited space in the overhead bins and you could check in for free. We did and after we boarded the plane found it was not full and there was plenty of space in the overhead bins. I’m not sure why they made this announcement.\nFront desk attendant wouldn’t check me in even though there was not a single person in line. Made me use the kiosk. Kiosk had an error (of course) no baggage can be checked at this kiosk please see attendant. Then I had to wait in line for the same front desk attendant waiting for 5 people who ended up coming in front of me while I tried to use a broken and useless kiosk. Finally after checked in, wait 30 min to board all the way to zone 6 and they would deny me even after all the zone 1-5 people already went. Just literally making us wait to board so they stand there doing nothing for 5 minutes. Just ridiculous and awful customer service. Fly with literally anyone else\nThey are a great airline, and i enjoying flying with them. However my experience with booking through Kayak was a horrible experience. With all the restrictions and glitches of website. My entire bookings by kayak was wrong. And there was no possible way of fixing anything with them, because they hand over responsibility to the airline after purchase is made. Will not be booking through Kayak again and will inform my family and friends not to as well.\nAll was good with comfort and ease of boarding. There was confusion from what gate to board at. Meant moving a long distance but I allowed plenty of time for this.\nNot what you’re looking for?

Situated in the fertile Ganga valley and on the banks of the Ganges, Varanasi is a place of pilgrimage for Hindus, who come to bathe in the holy river.

It’s also a centre of silk weaving, so practise haggling at the chaotic bazaar for some beautiful souvenirs. Rickshaws are the best way to get about.Read more\nNew DelhiLaid out by British architect Edwin Lutyens, the Indian capital is a striking modern metropolis. A gracious contrast to Old Delhi's winding streets, the grand avenues and stately buildings of New Delhi are rich with history and culture, from Gandhi's Delhi home (and the site of his assassination) to the tomb of Humayun, a complex of Mughal buildings reminiscent of the Taj Mahal. Chaotic traffic is best left to the locals. Negotiate a good price for taxis or travel on the new Delhi Metro.Read more\nUdaipurUdaipur, known as the Venice of the East, boasts several sparkling lakes against a backdrop of the Aravail hills.

The Stone House, a landmark 1822 bungalow, and St. Stephen's Church are remnants of the area's first British settlement.

A gracious contrast to Old Delhi's winding streets, the grand avenues and stately buildings of New Delhi are rich with history and culture, from Gandhi's Delhi home (and the site of his assassination) to the tomb of Humayun, a complex of Mughal buildings reminiscent of the Taj Mahal. Chaotic traffic is best left to the locals. Negotiate a good price for taxis or travel on the new Delhi Metro.Read moreUdaipurUdaipur, known as the Venice of the East, boasts several sparkling lakes against a backdrop of the Aravail hills. Jag Niwas and Jag Mandir, islands in Fateh Sagar Lake, are the site of Udaipur Solar Observatory and Nehru Garden. Famous palaces include the magical Lake Palace, now a luxurious five-star hotel, and the massive City Palace on Pichola’s east bank, featuring epic courtyards and stunning paintings.Read morePondicherryBlossoming bougainvilleas, crumbling cathedrals on leafy boulevards and 18th-century colonial buildings colour the former French colony of Pondy, which sits on the Bay of Bengal. But it's also unmistakably Indian, with colourful festivals throughout the year, several mosques and the Sri Aurobindo Ashram. Quiet beaches stretch north and south from town, good for swimming and sunrise strolls. Pondy is a popular weekend getaway destination from Chennai and is easy to navigate on foot or by bicycle.Read moreMumbaiMumbai (formerly known as Bombay), India, is famous for its chaotic streets. For bargains and people-watching, outdoor bazaars top the list of attractions. Popular waterfront destinations are Marine Drive, where visitors go to watch the sun set over the Arabian Sea, and the carnival-like Juhu Beach. More sightseeing options are the Gandhi Museum, in the leader's former home, and the cave temples of Elephanta Island. For tranquillity, Mumbai has many religious sites, lakes and parks.Read moreOoty (Udhagamandalam)Popularly referred to as Ooty, this gem among southern hill resorts is covered in eucalyptus and pine trees and coffee and tea plantations. On a clear day, it's possible to see as far as the Mysore plateau from Dodabetta Peak, the district's most prominent viewpoint. The Stone House, a landmark 1822 bungalow, and St. Stephen's Church are remnants of the area's first British settlement. Also noteworthy: formal botanical gardens, a children's mini-garden and a contemporary art collection.Read moreGoaEast meets West in this sun-soaked state, where Indian culture intertwines with Portuguese influences left over from a 500-year occupation. The beaches have long served as a magnet for serene hedonists. To the north, the tourist-centric scene is prevalent, with an international flair that is now skewing more hip than hippie. Travel south for stretches of unspoiled sand and an escape from large resorts. Temples, mosques and wildlife sanctuaries provide diversions from the beach.Read morePrayagrajRead more[{\"@context\":\"http:\\u002F\\u002Fschema.org\",\"@type\":\"LocalBusiness\",\"name\":\"Singapore\",\"description\":\"\",\"url\":\"\",\"image\":\"https:\\u002F\\u002Fdynamic-media-cdn.tripadvisor.com\\u002Fmedia\\u002Fphoto-o\\u002F15\\u002F33\\u002Ffc\\u002Fb1\\u002Fsingapore.jpg?w=600&h=400&s=1\",\"address\":{\"@type\":\"PostalAddress\",\"addressCountry\":\"\",\"addressLocality\":\"\",\"addressRegion\":\"\",\"postalCode\":\"\",\"streetAddress\":\"\"}},{\"@context\":\"http:\\u002F\\u002Fschema.org\",\"@type\":\"LocalBusiness\",\"name\":\"Varanasi\",\"description\":\"\",\"url\":\"\",\"image\":\"https:\\u002F\\u002Fdynamic-media-cdn.tripadvisor.com\\u002Fmedia\\u002Fphoto-o\\u002F0a\\u002Fbe\\u002F17\\u002F41\\u002Fcaption.jpg?w=600&h=400&s=1\",\"address\":{\"@type\":\"PostalAddress\",\"addressCountry\":\"\",\"addressLocality\":\"\",\"addressRegion\":\"\",\"postalCode\":\"\",\"streetAddress\":\"\"}},{\"@context\":\"http:\\u002F\\u002Fschema.org\",\"@type\":\"LocalBusiness\",\"name\":\"New Delhi\",\"description\":\"\",\"url\":\"\",\"image\":\"https:\\u002F\\u002Fdynamic-media-cdn.tripadvisor.com\\u002Fmedia\\u002Fphoto-o\\u002F24\\u002F03\\u002F3f\\u002Ffd\\u002Fcaption.jpg?w=600&h=400&s=1&cx=2294&cy=1952&chk=v1_c3b28b866491ff3722ce\",\"address\":{\"@type\":\"PostalAddress\",\"addressCountry\":\"\",\"addressLocality\":\"\",\"addressRegion\":\"\",\"postalCode\":\"\",\"streetAddress\":\"\"}},{\"@context\":\"http:\\u002F\\u002Fschema.org\",\"@type\":\"LocalBusiness\",\"name\":\"Udaipur\",\"description\":\"\",\"url\":\"\",\"image\":\"https:\\u002F\\u002Fdynamic-media-cdn.tripadvisor.com\\u002Fmedia\\u002Fphoto-o\\u002F01\\u002Fd3\\u002F67\\u002Fe4\\u002Fsas-bahu.jpg?w=600&h=400&s=1\",\"address\":{\"@type\":\"PostalAddress\",\"addressCountry\":\"\",\"addressLocality\":\"\",\"addressRegion\":\"\",\"postalCode\":\"\",\"streetAddress\":\"\"}},{\"@context\":\"http:\\u002F\\u002Fschema.org\",\"@type\":\"LocalBusiness\",\"name\":\"Pondicherry\",\"description\":\"\",\"url\":\"\",\"image\":\"https:\\u002F\\u002Fdynamic-media-cdn.tripadvisor.com\\u002Fmedia\\u002Fphoto-o\\u002F11\\u002Ff4\\u002F3b\\u002F43\\u002Fboating.jpg?w=600&h=400&s=1\",\"address\":{\"@type\":\"PostalAddress\",\"addressCountry\":\"\",\"addressLocality\":\"\",\"addressRegion\":\"\",\"postalCode\":\"\",\"streetAddress\":\"\"}},{\"@context\":\"http:\\u002F\\u002Fschema.org\",\"@type\":\"LocalBusiness\",\"name\":\"Mumbai\",\"description\":\"\",\"url\":\"\",\"image\":\"https:\\u002F\\u002Fdynamic-media-cdn.tripadvisor.com\\u002Fmedia\\u002Fphoto-o\\u002F0b\\u002F4e\\u002F55\\u002Fe6\\u002Fchhatrapati-shivaji-terminus.jpg?w=600&h=400&s=1\",\"address\":{\"@type\":\"PostalAddress\",\"addressCountry\":\"\",\"addressLocality\":\"\",\"addressRegion\":\"\",\"postalCode\":\"\",\"streetAddress\":\"\"}},{\"@context\":\"http:\\u002F\\u002Fschema.org\",\"@type\":\"LocalBusiness\",\"name\":\"Ooty (Udhagamandalam)\",\"description\":\"\",\"url\":\"\",\"image\":\"https:\\u002F\\u002Fdynamic-media-cdn.tripadvisor.com\\u002Fmedia\\u002Fphoto-o\\u002F0a\\u002F84\\u002F3c\\u002Fbc\\u002Fupper-bhavani-lake.jpg?w=600&h=400&s=1\",\"address\":{\"@type\":\"PostalAddress\",\"addressCountry\":\"\",\"addressLocality\":\"\",\"addressRegion\":\"\",\"postalCode\":\"\",\"streetAddress\":\"\"}},{\"@context\":\"http:\\u002F\\u002Fschema.org\",\"@type\":\"LocalBusiness\",\"name\":\"Goa\",\"description\":\"\",\"url\":\"\",\"image\":\"https:\\u002F\\u002Fdynamic-media-cdn.tripadvisor.com\\u002Fmedia\\u002Fphoto-o\\u002F15\\u002F33\\u002Ffc\\u002Ff0\\u002Fgoa.jpg?w=600&h=400&s=1\",\"address\":{\"@type\":\"PostalAddress\",\"addressCountry\":\"\",\"addressLocality\":\"\",\"addressRegion\":\"\",\"postalCode\":\"\",\"streetAddress\":\"\"}},{\"@context\":\"http:\\u002F\\u002Fschema.org\",\"@type\":\"LocalBusiness\",\"name\":\"Prayagraj\",\"description\":\"\",\"url\":\"\",\"image\":\"https:\\u002F\\u002Fdynamic-media-cdn.tripadvisor.com\\u002Fmedia\\u002Fphoto-o\\u002F0f\\u002Fae\\u002Fb4\\u002F68\\u002Ffort-on-the-side.jpg?w=600&h=400&s=1\",\"address\":{\"@type\":\"PostalAddress\",\"addressCountry\":\"\",\"addressLocality\":\"\",\"addressRegion\":\"\",\"postalCode\":\"\",\"streetAddress\":\"\"}}]Popular Kyoto CategoriesDowntown HotelsHotels with KitchenetteHotels with Free BreakfastHotels with ShuttleBoutique HotelsHistoric HotelsUnique HotelsHotels with Breakfast BuffetHotels with Smoking RoomsHoneymoon HotelsCheap Hotels informationCheap Hotels Kyoto32Cheap Hotels Prices From₹3,472Cheap Hotels Reviews18,500Cheap Hotels Photos14,767Frequently Asked Questions about cheap hotelsWhat are the best cheap hotels near Kiyomizu-dera Temple?Some of the more popular cheap hotels near Kiyomizu-dera Temple include:Mume -

Once at gate when time to board, had to take standing room bus to the tarmac to board. Did not like getting out to plane and having to wait 5 minutes until they opened bus door.\nThis flight was leg 2 of 2 leg journey. The staff at baggage re-drop in Tokyo were fabulous. Once at gate when time to board, had to take standing room bus to the tarmac to board. Did not like getting out to plane and having to wait 5 minutes until they opened bus door.\nFirst experience with JAL so was okay to pretty good. 10 hour flight in premium select seat. . Seats in that category should be better than pretty good. Seat pan a little short for tall people but plenty of leg room; I think JAL in process of new planes? Also, — they could have offered a bit more water throughout flight and meals not the greatest. That said, certainly 200 percent better than a very recent AK Air International flight in similar cabin class in comfort and meals.\nIt's a domestic flight, but still the JAL quality shone through. The crew were polite and helpful and even prepared little gifts / souvenirs for the children on the flight, and everyone got a simple drink. The free wifi for entertainment on the personal device was also a great boon, and the shows surprisingly decent. Would recommend.\nWe ordered for non vegetarian Hindu meal but instead they served us vegetarian Hindu meal. That was also not good. It was very annoying and aggravating. Hope our return from Tokyo to jfk on March 27 same is not repeated. Caterar should understand difference between non vegetarian Hindu meal and vegetarian Hindu meal.\nAllow gold card holders (Group 1) to board with their guest like other One World carriers do\nChecked baggage process is confusing and time consuming especially when checking oversized bags. Very slow agents didn't help.\nFood was great, Entertainment was bad, movies were not current and just did not have good variety. Granted I was tired so cranky might have played into my evaluation. Overall based on cost I definitely would fly them again. I am a million mile flyer on another airline, the service on JAL really beats all airlines.\nThe team members are extremely attentive to make sure you have the best experience.\nWas in premium economy. It is slightly better than economy, but the way the seat reclines actually makes it harder to sit (the seat slides forward and the foot rest comes up - you can lie fairly well reclined but you’ll have to sit cross legged because there is no place for your legs to stretch out. Food is basic economy. Service was great. All in all good, but may make more sense to pay more for business or save a bit and just sit in economy.\nSeats in \"Premium Economy\" were noticeably more comfortable than those in \"Economy\" and worth the price. My only reservation is that the foot rest did not go higher up. If it did, it would have made the seat much more comfortable.\nThis was the best airline I’ve ever taken. The staff are amazing. The food was great. The pilot was phenomenal. I would highly recommend this airline.\nThere wasn't much entertainment for my short flight but the onboarding process was smooth and the crew provided wonderful service. The seats were also reasonably comfy. Great flight.\nI had to get rerouted because the weather delayed my flight enough to miss both of my connecting flights. I select nearly 2 hours on customer service trying to get rerouted and had to miss my first plane which took my luggage to San Francisco. Luckily, customer service sent me to the same airport but I had to ride 12 hours in economy after I paid extra for premium economy. Totally sucks that I overpaid. Customer service and airplane crew were great and really helpful though. Although I still hate how small the seat was, especially since I'm smaller than average, I can't imagine how much it would suck for an average sized person.\nCabin crew were excellent in taking care of my mom as she boarded the aircraft from her wheelchair. Did not care much for the food served.\nI stopped flying with United back in the nineties. Today's experience reminded me of why.\nGreat airline all together - triple 7 for a short flight was a plus - lots of room\nWonderfully pleasant experience. Good meal and beverage selections. Professional air staff.\nSeat width can be a bit wider. not nice that they charge extra for the window seats. online check in can be greatly improved. in other words, their online interface is bad.\nSeat width can be a bit wider. not nice that they charge extra for the window seats.\nSeats were comfortable with excellent legroom. Meals were also quite good. The cabin crew were excellent and very helpful. The check-in experience was also very smooth.\nMost relaxing long distance flight I have been on. And I have flown on many.\nNot great, will likely try to fly another or maybe I should have upgraded my ticket? Needed Air…\nI don’t think I’ll be flying them again. Tight seats, no flowing air or air nozzles that you can turn air on you, for those who could have motion sickness this would be your worst nightmare. The pilot was great and experienced (which is what you want when flying 12 hours) overall I’m thankful knowledgeable pilots!\nMy ticket did not indication which group I was in for boarding; the gate attended help me\nVery routh cabin crew food is only 2 meals for 13 hours fry with them They should get better training how to service good super routh language and talking with customer\nstaff are super nice and effiecient! It was a very comfortable and relaxing flight\nBoarding could have been a little bit better but other than that it was a pretty good experience. I think because of the stowaway to Paris France recently they are being extra diligent about boarding passes at the gate. But they boarded the back of the plane first, and that's something I really think needs to start in the USA.\nI was ordered vegetarian food, but didn't services to me :(\nI did not take the flight, tried to cancel it right after I booked it, but was unable to reach anyone. I blame Kayak for this situation because they sent the booking through another company and I was unable to get anyone to talk to me about the situation. I had to just take the hit and pay for another flight through Cathay Pacific, which was wonderful. I will never use Kayak again. (I bet they don’t post this review!) I’ll just post about them on social media sites. I don’t want anyone to have to go through the hassle and expense I dealt with.\nAirline itself is great. While food was being taken off of my tray my beer spilled which was a total accident and I wasn’t upset about that, what was frustrating was I had to ask for towels to clean up and wipe my leg. It would have been left as is if I hadn’t.\nThe seats felt very small. We were supplied with pillows and blankets, which was nice. Lots of noise from the bathroom, plus exterior noise. Made it hard to hear the entertainment system, even using my own noise-cancelling headphones. The food was really bad. I generally request a vegetarian meal and one was supplied, but the pasta was cold and hard and there was nothing pleasant about it. Two meals were served on this flight; one was a repeat of the meal I had had on the flight immediately preceding this one, which was bad enough I didn't even try it. Drinks were very limited. All I wanted was water, and on a 10.5 hour flight, I was given 3 cups of about 3 ounces each.\nThe seats felt very small. We were supplied with pillows and blankets, which was nice.

I generally request a vegetarian meal and one was supplied, but the pasta was cold and hard and there was nothing pleasant about it. Drinks were very limited. All I wanted was water, and on a 4 hour flight, I was given 2 cups of about 3 ounces each.\nEverything was perfect. A flight attendant even brought me snacks after I declined food due to my desire to force myself to follow the destination time zone.\nFor the most part, it was an enjoyable experience. It's the 2nd half of the journey was a bit uncomfortable. It was on a noticable smaller plane compared to the previous one.\nOnly process that my luggage didn’t make it to my destination because of short connection but I understand\nThe boarding process was good. The toilet could be better maintained.\nThis has been the worst experience I've ever had. We arrived to Ho Chi Minh Airport and were supposed to get our Asiana ticket from the transfer counter as we came with a different airline. However, the staff at the transfer counter were not helpful and kept giving us different information. We were first told by Asiana airlines staff we had to wait 2 hours so they could print out and give us our tickets, then someone else told us we had to wait 3hrs, someone told us \"I don't know, just go sit and wait and we will tell you later.\" This was at a place in the Ho Chi Minh airport that had no coffee or food shops, nothing, just immigration (to enter Vietnam with a Vietnam Visa) and security (to transfer into the gates) but we needed our printed boarding pass to go through. It wasn't until we demanded to speak to a supervisor as our flight time was 1hr away because they kept telling us \"there's alot of time left for your international flight, we will get your tickets later\" we still had to wait around 20minutes for the \"Supervisor\" to give us our tickets. I would NOT recommend Asiana Airlines, especially if going thru Ho Chi Minh Airport as they are not helpful. (We almost missed our flight, due to their lazyness and incompetence of printing our tickets) I would suggest Asiana Airlines to have a Machine in the transfer area so passengers can easily print out their boarding passes themselves and save some money by not hiring incompetent staff that can't do a simple task such as printing a boarding pass.\nGreat service. They could offer vegetarian food and do more to reduce waste.\nI like the food, the crew and everything.!!! Except for the delay in our flight.\nGreat service and comfortable seats. The first meal was excellent but the second meal was only satisfactory\nEverything went smoothly. I appreciate the selection of free movies.\nI like the friendliness of the crew members. I think the snack could’ve been better instead of a small package of pretzel. I like that they offer me something to drink.\nThe TSA agents in Phoenix were incredibly rude and confiscated belongings that we wanted to check. The flight got changed without our knowledge to a worse situation. The whole thing was terrible\nAir Canada was great! From the airport at Montreal to boarding to the food on board the plane. The crew was great too! There was a slight issue with some other peoples’ tickets that I overheard about but the crew handled with care immediately to ensure everyone was comfortable and we could takeoff! Great experience with Air Canada\nMy experience with Air Canada was good. Great customer service… only a few delays and issues with the tunnel to exit the plain. I did not appreciate that we arrived at terminal D and had to go to terminal E to get the bags/ luggage.\nPDX staff was great and we arrived on time in YVR.\nThey announced before boarding that the flight was full and there would be limited space in the overhead bins and you could check in for free. We did and after we boarded the plane found it was not full and there was plenty of space in the overhead bins. I’m not sure why they made this announcement.\nFront desk attendant wouldn’t check me in even though there was not a single person in line. Made me use the kiosk. Kiosk had an error (of course) no baggage can be checked at this kiosk please see attendant. Then I had to wait in line for the same front desk attendant waiting for 5 people who ended up coming in front of me while I tried to use a broken and useless kiosk. Finally after checked in, wait 30 min to board all the way to zone 6 and they would deny me even after all the zone 1-5 people already went. Just literally making us wait to board so they stand there doing nothing for 5 minutes. Just ridiculous and awful customer service. Fly with literally anyone else\nThey are a great airline, and i enjoying flying with them. However my experience with booking through Kayak was a horrible experience. With all the restrictions and glitches of website. My entire bookings by kayak was wrong. And there was no possible way of fixing anything with them, because they hand over responsibility to the airline after purchase is made. Will not be booking through Kayak again and will inform my family and friends not to as well.\nAll was good with comfort and ease of boarding. There was confusion from what gate to board at. Meant moving a long distance but I allowed plenty of time for this.\nNot what you’re looking for?

Once at gate when time to board, had to take standing room bus to the tarmac to board. Did not like getting out to plane and having to wait 5 minutes until they opened bus door.\nThis flight was leg 2 of 2 leg journey. The staff at baggage re-drop in Tokyo were fabulous. Once at gate when time to board, had to take standing room bus to the tarmac to board. Did not like getting out to plane and having to wait 5 minutes until they opened bus door.\nFirst experience with JAL so was okay to pretty good. 10 hour flight in premium select seat. . Seats in that category should be better than pretty good. Seat pan a little short for tall people but plenty of leg room; I think JAL in process of new planes? Also, — they could have offered a bit more water throughout flight and meals not the greatest. That said, certainly 200 percent better than a very recent AK Air International flight in similar cabin class in comfort and meals.\nIt's a domestic flight, but still the JAL quality shone through. The crew were polite and helpful and even prepared little gifts / souvenirs for the children on the flight, and everyone got a simple drink. The free wifi for entertainment on the personal device was also a great boon, and the shows surprisingly decent. Would recommend.\nWe ordered for non vegetarian Hindu meal but instead they served us vegetarian Hindu meal. That was also not good. It was very annoying and aggravating. Hope our return from Tokyo to jfk on March 27 same is not repeated. Caterar should understand difference between non vegetarian Hindu meal and vegetarian Hindu meal.\nAllow gold card holders (Group 1) to board with their guest like other One World carriers do\nChecked baggage process is confusing and time consuming especially when checking oversized bags. Very slow agents didn't help.\nFood was great, Entertainment was bad, movies were not current and just did not have good variety. Granted I was tired so cranky might have played into my evaluation. Overall based on cost I definitely would fly them again. I am a million mile flyer on another airline, the service on JAL really beats all airlines.\nThe team members are extremely attentive to make sure you have the best experience.\nWas in premium economy. It is slightly better than economy, but the way the seat reclines actually makes it harder to sit (the seat slides forward and the foot rest comes up - you can lie fairly well reclined but you’ll have to sit cross legged because there is no place for your legs to stretch out. Food is basic economy. Service was great. All in all good, but may make more sense to pay more for business or save a bit and just sit in economy.\nSeats in \"Premium Economy\" were noticeably more comfortable than those in \"Economy\" and worth the price. My only reservation is that the foot rest did not go higher up. If it did, it would have made the seat much more comfortable.\nThis was the best airline I’ve ever taken. The staff are amazing. The food was great. The pilot was phenomenal. I would highly recommend this airline.\nThere wasn't much entertainment for my short flight but the onboarding process was smooth and the crew provided wonderful service. The seats were also reasonably comfy. Great flight.\nI had to get rerouted because the weather delayed my flight enough to miss both of my connecting flights. I select nearly 2 hours on customer service trying to get rerouted and had to miss my first plane which took my luggage to San Francisco. Luckily, customer service sent me to the same airport but I had to ride 12 hours in economy after I paid extra for premium economy. Totally sucks that I overpaid. Customer service and airplane crew were great and really helpful though. Although I still hate how small the seat was, especially since I'm smaller than average, I can't imagine how much it would suck for an average sized person.\nCabin crew were excellent in taking care of my mom as she boarded the aircraft from her wheelchair. Did not care much for the food served.\nI stopped flying with United back in the nineties. Today's experience reminded me of why.\nGreat airline all together - triple 7 for a short flight was a plus - lots of room\nWonderfully pleasant experience. Good meal and beverage selections. Professional air staff.\nSeat width can be a bit wider. not nice that they charge extra for the window seats. online check in can be greatly improved. in other words, their online interface is bad.\nSeat width can be a bit wider. not nice that they charge extra for the window seats.\nSeats were comfortable with excellent legroom. Meals were also quite good. The cabin crew were excellent and very helpful. The check-in experience was also very smooth.\nMost relaxing long distance flight I have been on. And I have flown on many.\nNot great, will likely try to fly another or maybe I should have upgraded my ticket? Needed Air…\nI don’t think I’ll be flying them again. Tight seats, no flowing air or air nozzles that you can turn air on you, for those who could have motion sickness this would be your worst nightmare. The pilot was great and experienced (which is what you want when flying 12 hours) overall I’m thankful knowledgeable pilots!\nMy ticket did not indication which group I was in for boarding; the gate attended help me\nVery routh cabin crew food is only 2 meals for 13 hours fry with them They should get better training how to service good super routh language and talking with customer\nstaff are super nice and effiecient! It was a very comfortable and relaxing flight\nBoarding could have been a little bit better but other than that it was a pretty good experience. I think because of the stowaway to Paris France recently they are being extra diligent about boarding passes at the gate. But they boarded the back of the plane first, and that's something I really think needs to start in the USA.\nI was ordered vegetarian food, but didn't services to me :(\nI did not take the flight, tried to cancel it right after I booked it, but was unable to reach anyone. I blame Kayak for this situation because they sent the booking through another company and I was unable to get anyone to talk to me about the situation. I had to just take the hit and pay for another flight through Cathay Pacific, which was wonderful. I will never use Kayak again. (I bet they don’t post this review!) I’ll just post about them on social media sites. I don’t want anyone to have to go through the hassle and expense I dealt with.\nAirline itself is great. While food was being taken off of my tray my beer spilled which was a total accident and I wasn’t upset about that, what was frustrating was I had to ask for towels to clean up and wipe my leg. It would have been left as is if I hadn’t.\nThe seats felt very small. We were supplied with pillows and blankets, which was nice. Lots of noise from the bathroom, plus exterior noise. Made it hard to hear the entertainment system, even using my own noise-cancelling headphones. The food was really bad. I generally request a vegetarian meal and one was supplied, but the pasta was cold and hard and there was nothing pleasant about it. Two meals were served on this flight; one was a repeat of the meal I had had on the flight immediately preceding this one, which was bad enough I didn't even try it. Drinks were very limited. All I wanted was water, and on a 10.5 hour flight, I was given 3 cups of about 3 ounces each.\nThe seats felt very small. We were supplied with pillows and blankets, which was nice.

All I wanted was water, and on a 4 hour flight, I was given 2 cups of about 3 ounces each.\nEverything was perfect. A flight attendant even brought me snacks after I declined food due to my desire to force myself to follow the destination time zone.\nFor the most part, it was an enjoyable experience. It's the 2nd half of the journey was a bit uncomfortable. It was on a noticable smaller plane compared to the previous one.\nOnly process that my luggage didn’t make it to my destination because of short connection but I understand\nThe boarding process was good. The toilet could be better maintained.\nThis has been the worst experience I've ever had. We arrived to Ho Chi Minh Airport and were supposed to get our Asiana ticket from the transfer counter as we came with a different airline. However, the staff at the transfer counter were not helpful and kept giving us different information. We were first told by Asiana airlines staff we had to wait 2 hours so they could print out and give us our tickets, then someone else told us we had to wait 3hrs, someone told us \"I don't know, just go sit and wait and we will tell you later.\" This was at a place in the Ho Chi Minh airport that had no coffee or food shops, nothing, just immigration (to enter Vietnam with a Vietnam Visa) and security (to transfer into the gates) but we needed our printed boarding pass to go through. It wasn't until we demanded to speak to a supervisor as our flight time was 1hr away because they kept telling us \"there's alot of time left for your international flight, we will get your tickets later\" we still had to wait around 20minutes for the \"Supervisor\" to give us our tickets. I would NOT recommend Asiana Airlines, especially if going thru Ho Chi Minh Airport as they are not helpful. (We almost missed our flight, due to their lazyness and incompetence of printing our tickets) I would suggest Asiana Airlines to have a Machine in the transfer area so passengers can easily print out their boarding passes themselves and save some money by not hiring incompetent staff that can't do a simple task such as printing a boarding pass.\nGreat service. They could offer vegetarian food and do more to reduce waste.\nI like the food, the crew and everything.!!! Except for the delay in our flight.\nGreat service and comfortable seats. The first meal was excellent but the second meal was only satisfactory\nEverything went smoothly. I appreciate the selection of free movies.\nI like the friendliness of the crew members. I think the snack could’ve been better instead of a small package of pretzel. I like that they offer me something to drink.\nThe TSA agents in Phoenix were incredibly rude and confiscated belongings that we wanted to check. The flight got changed without our knowledge to a worse situation. The whole thing was terrible\nAir Canada was great! From the airport at Montreal to boarding to the food on board the plane. The crew was great too! There was a slight issue with some other peoples’ tickets that I overheard about but the crew handled with care immediately to ensure everyone was comfortable and we could takeoff! Great experience with Air Canada\nMy experience with Air Canada was good. Great customer service… only a few delays and issues with the tunnel to exit the plain. I did not appreciate that we arrived at terminal D and had to go to terminal E to get the bags/ luggage.\nPDX staff was great and we arrived on time in YVR.\nThey announced before boarding that the flight was full and there would be limited space in the overhead bins and you could check in for free. We did and after we boarded the plane found it was not full and there was plenty of space in the overhead bins. I’m not sure why they made this announcement.\nFront desk attendant wouldn’t check me in even though there was not a single person in line. Made me use the kiosk. Kiosk had an error (of course) no baggage can be checked at this kiosk please see attendant. Then I had to wait in line for the same front desk attendant waiting for 5 people who ended up coming in front of me while I tried to use a broken and useless kiosk. Finally after checked in, wait 30 min to board all the way to zone 6 and they would deny me even after all the zone 1-5 people already went. Just literally making us wait to board so they stand there doing nothing for 5 minutes. Just ridiculous and awful customer service. Fly with literally anyone else\nThey are a great airline, and i enjoying flying with them. However my experience with booking through Kayak was a horrible experience. With all the restrictions and glitches of website. My entire bookings by kayak was wrong. And there was no possible way of fixing anything with them, because they hand over responsibility to the airline after purchase is made. Will not be booking through Kayak again and will inform my family and friends not to as well.\nAll was good with comfort and ease of boarding. There was confusion from what gate to board at. Meant moving a long distance but I allowed plenty of time for this.\nNot what you’re looking for?

But it's also unmistakably Indian, with colourful festivals throughout the year, several mosques and the Sri Aurobindo Ashram. Quiet beaches stretch north and south from town, good for swimming and sunrise strolls. Pondy is a popular weekend getaway destination from Chennai and is easy to navigate on foot or by bicycle.Read more\nMumbaiMumbai (formerly known as Bombay), India, is famous for its chaotic streets. For bargains and people-watching, outdoor bazaars top the list of attractions. Popular waterfront destinations are Marine Drive, where visitors go to watch the sun set over the Arabian Sea, and the carnival-like Juhu Beach. More sightseeing options are the Gandhi Museum, in the leader's former home, and the cave temples of Elephanta Island. For tranquillity, Mumbai has many religious sites, lakes and parks.Read more\nOoty (Udhagamandalam)Popularly referred to as Ooty, this gem among southern hill resorts is covered in eucalyptus and pine trees and coffee and tea plantations.

The Stone House, a landmark 1822 bungalow, and St. Stephen's Church are remnants of the area's first British settlement. Also noteworthy: formal botanical gardens, a children's mini-garden and a contemporary art collection.Read more\nGoaEast meets West in this sun-soaked state, where Indian culture intertwines with Portuguese influences left over from a 500-year occupation. The beaches have long served as a magnet for serene hedonists. To the north, the tourist-centric scene is prevalent, with an international flair that is now skewing more hip than hippie. Travel south for stretches of unspoiled sand and an escape from large resorts. Temples, mosques and wildlife sanctuaries provide diversions from the beach.Read more\nPrayagrajRead more\nDowntown Hotels\nHotels with Kitchenette\nHotels with Free Breakfast\nHotels with Shuttle\nBoutique Hotels\nHistoric Hotels\nUnique Hotels\nHotels with Breakfast Buffet\nHotels with Smoking Rooms\nHoneymoon Hotels\n\n\nMAIN CONTENT:\nAsiaJapanKinkiKyoto PrefectureKyotoKyoto HotelsBudget Hotels in Kyoto{\"@context\":\"http:\\u002F\\u002Fschema.org\",\"@type\":\"BreadcrumbList\",\"itemListElement\":[{\"@type\":\"ListItem\",\"position\":\"1\",\"item\":\"https:\\u002F\\u002Fwww.tripadvisor.in\\u002FTourism-g2-Asia-Vacations.html\",\"name\":\"Asia\"},{\"@type\":\"ListItem\",\"position\":\"2\",\"item\":\"https:\\u002F\\u002Fwww.tripadvisor.in\\u002FTourism-g294232-Japan-Vacations.html\",\"name\":\"Japan\"},{\"@type\":\"ListItem\",\"position\":\"3\",\"item\":\"https:\\u002F\\u002Fwww.tripadvisor.in\\u002FTourism-g298189-Kinki-Vacations.html\",\"name\":\"Kinki\"},{\"@type\":\"ListItem\",\"position\":\"4\",\"item\":\"https:\\u002F\\u002Fwww.tripadvisor.in\\u002FTourism-g298563-Kyoto_Prefecture_Kinki-Vacations.html\",\"name\":\"Kyoto Prefecture\"},{\"@type\":\"ListItem\",\"position\":\"5\",\"item\":\"https:\\u002F\\u002Fwww.tripadvisor.in\\u002FTourism-g298564-Kyoto_Kyoto_Prefecture_Kinki-Vacations.html\",\"name\":\"Kyoto\"},{\"@type\":\"ListItem\",\"position\":\"6\",\"item\":\"https:\\u002F\\u002Fwww.tripadvisor.in\\u002FHotels-g298564-Kyoto_Kyoto_Prefecture_Kinki-Hotels.html\",\"name\":\"Kyoto Hotels\"},{\"@type\":\"ListItem\",\"position\":\"7\",\"name\":\"Budget Hotels in Kyoto\"}]}THE 10 BEST Cheap Hotels in Kyoto 2025{\"@context\":\"http:\\u002F\\u002Fschema.org\",\"@type\":\"FAQPage\",\"mainEntity\":[{\"@type\":\"Question\",\"name\":\"What are the best cheap hotels near Kiyomizu-dera Temple?\",\"acceptedAnswer\":{\"@type\":\"Answer\",\"text\":\"\\u003Cdiv class='faqItem'\\u003E\\u003Cdiv class='answer'\\u003ESome of the more popular cheap hotels near Kiyomizu-dera Temple include:\\u003C\\u002Fdiv\\u003E\\u003Cdiv class='hotels'\\u003E\\u003Ca href='\\u002FHotel_Review-g298564-d1547516-Reviews-Mume-Kyoto_Kyoto_Prefecture_Kinki.html'\\u003EMume\\u003C\\u002Fa\\u003E\\u003Cspan class='description'\\u003E -

(Just make sure you heed the local laws—something like spitting in the street might merely be considered rude in your hometown, but here, it carries a severe penalty.) You'll find historic sites like the Thian Hock Keng temple, superlative shopping (including gargantuan malls) and numerous beaches.Read moreVaranasiThe north Indian city of Varanasi, or Benares, is regarded as sacred by Hindus, Buddhists and Jains. Situated in the fertile Ganga valley and on the banks of the Ganges, Varanasi is a place of pilgrimage for Hindus, who come to bathe in the holy river. Known as the City of Temples and a beacon of culture, Varanasi has produced many renowned writers. It’s also a centre of silk weaving, so practise haggling at the chaotic bazaar for some beautiful souvenirs. Rickshaws are the best way to get about.Read moreNew DelhiLaid out by British architect Edwin Lutyens, the Indian capital is a striking modern metropolis. A gracious contrast to Old Delhi's winding streets, the grand avenues and stately buildings of New Delhi are rich with history and culture, from Gandhi's Delhi home (and the site of his assassination) to the tomb of Humayun, a complex of Mughal buildings reminiscent of the Taj Mahal. Chaotic traffic is best left to the locals. Negotiate a good price for taxis or travel on the new Delhi Metro.Read moreUdaipurUdaipur, known as the Venice of the East, boasts several sparkling lakes against a backdrop of the Aravail hills. Jag Niwas and Jag Mandir, islands in Fateh Sagar Lake, are the site of Udaipur Solar Observatory and Nehru Garden. Famous palaces include the magical Lake Palace, now a luxurious five-star hotel, and the massive City Palace on Pichola’s east bank, featuring epic courtyards and stunning paintings.Read morePondicherryBlossoming bougainvilleas, crumbling cathedrals on leafy boulevards and 18th-century colonial buildings colour the former French colony of Pondy, which sits on the Bay of Bengal. But it's also unmistakably Indian, with colourful festivals throughout the year, several mosques and the Sri Aurobindo Ashram. Quiet beaches stretch north and south from town, good for swimming and sunrise strolls. Pondy is a popular weekend getaway destination from Chennai and is easy to navigate on foot or by bicycle.Read moreMumbaiMumbai (formerly known as Bombay), India, is famous for its chaotic streets. For bargains and people-watching, outdoor bazaars top the list of attractions. Popular waterfront destinations are Marine Drive, where visitors go to watch the sun set over the Arabian Sea, and the carnival-like Juhu Beach. More sightseeing options are the Gandhi Museum, in the leader's former home, and the cave temples of Elephanta Island. For tranquillity, Mumbai has many religious sites, lakes and parks.Read moreOoty (Udhagamandalam)Popularly referred to as Ooty, this gem among southern hill resorts is covered in eucalyptus and pine trees and coffee and tea plantations. On a clear day, it's possible to see as far as the Mysore plateau from Dodabetta Peak, the district's most prominent viewpoint. The Stone House, a landmark 1822 bungalow, and St. Stephen's Church are remnants of the area's first British settlement. Also noteworthy: formal botanical gardens, a children's mini-garden and a contemporary art collection.Read moreGoaEast meets West in this sun-soaked state, where Indian culture intertwines with Portuguese influences left over from a 500-year occupation. The beaches have long served as a magnet for serene hedonists. To the north, the tourist-centric scene is prevalent, with an international flair that is now skewing more hip than hippie. Travel south for stretches of unspoiled sand and an escape from large resorts.

In 2010, festivities are in the works to celebrate this ancient city's anniversary. \"Old Japan\" is still easy to spot here, from Great Buddha Hall to traditional ryokans and the serene Isuien garden. travellers rave about walking tours of Nara, particularly in the historic Naramachi merchant area.Read more\nHigashiomiRead more\nOsakaHome to nearly nine million and powering an economy that exceeds both Hong Kong's and Thailand's, Osaka packs quite a punch. The confident, stylish city is a shopping hub, with fabulous restaurants and nightlife. It's an ideal base for exploring the Kansai region: Kyoto's World Heritage Sites, Nara's temple and Koya-san's eerie graves are within 90 minutes by train. Top city attractions include the aquarium, Osaka Castle, Universal Studios Japan and the futuristic Floating Garden Observatory.Read more\nTakashimaRead more\nHashimotoRead more\nNagoyaCommerce keeps Nagoya’s downtown popping with life, but there’s more than just manufacturing to this industrial powerhouse. Nagoyans meet for plates of crisp-friend miso katsu; make weekend trips to nearby Shinto shrines; and count down the days to the city’s autumn Nagoya Festival.Read more\nKainanRead more\nAwaji-shimaRead more\nSingaporeSingapore is known as a bustling metropolis that also happens to be one of the cleanest and safest cities of its size in the world. (Just make sure you heed the local laws—something like spitting in the street might merely be considered rude in your hometown, but here, it carries a severe penalty.) You'll find historic sites like the Thian Hock Keng temple, superlative shopping (including gargantuan malls) and numerous beaches.Read more\nVaranasiThe north Indian city of Varanasi, or Benares, is regarded as sacred by Hindus, Buddhists and Jains. Situated in the fertile Ganga valley and on the banks of the Ganges, Varanasi is a place of pilgrimage for Hindus, who come to bathe in the holy river. Known as the City of Temples and a beacon of culture, Varanasi has produced many renowned writers. It’s also a centre of silk weaving, so practise haggling at the chaotic bazaar for some beautiful souvenirs. Rickshaws are the best way to get about.Read more\nNew DelhiLaid out by British architect Edwin Lutyens, the Indian capital is a striking modern metropolis. A gracious contrast to Old Delhi's winding streets, the grand avenues and stately buildings of New Delhi are rich with history and culture, from Gandhi's Delhi home (and the site of his assassination) to the tomb of Humayun, a complex of Mughal buildings reminiscent of the Taj Mahal. Chaotic traffic is best left to the locals. Negotiate a good price for taxis or travel on the new Delhi Metro.Read more\nUdaipurUdaipur, known as the Venice of the East, boasts several sparkling lakes against a backdrop of the Aravail hills. Jag Niwas and Jag Mandir, islands in Fateh Sagar Lake, are the site of Udaipur Solar Observatory and Nehru Garden. Famous palaces include the magical Lake Palace, now a luxurious five-star hotel, and the massive City Palace on Pichola’s east bank, featuring epic courtyards and stunning paintings.Read more\nPondicherryBlossoming bougainvilleas, crumbling cathedrals on leafy boulevards and 18th-century colonial buildings colour the former French colony of Pondy, which sits on the Bay of Bengal. But it's also unmistakably Indian, with colourful festivals throughout the year, several mosques and the Sri Aurobindo Ashram. Quiet beaches stretch north and south from town, good for swimming and sunrise strolls. Pondy is a popular weekend getaway destination from Chennai and is easy to navigate on foot or by bicycle.Read more\nMumbaiMumbai (formerly known as Bombay), India, is famous for its chaotic streets. For bargains and people-watching, outdoor bazaars top the list of attractions. Popular waterfront destinations are Marine Drive, where visitors go to watch the sun set over the Arabian Sea, and the carnival-like Juhu Beach. More sightseeing options are the Gandhi Museum, in the leader's former home, and the cave temples of Elephanta Island. For tranquillity, Mumbai has many religious sites, lakes and parks.Read more\nOoty (Udhagamandalam)Popularly referred to as Ooty, this gem among southern hill resorts is covered in eucalyptus and pine trees and coffee and tea plantations. On a clear day, it's possible to see as far as the Mysore plateau from Dodabetta Peak, the district's most prominent viewpoint. The Stone House, a landmark 1822 bungalow, and St. Stephen's Church are remnants of the area's first British settlement. Also noteworthy: formal botanical gardens, a children's mini-garden and a contemporary art collection.Read more\nGoaEast meets West in this sun-soaked state, where Indian culture intertwines with Portuguese influences left over from a 500-year occupation.

(Just make sure you heed the local laws—something like spitting in the street might merely be considered rude in your hometown, but here, it carries a severe penalty.) You'll find historic sites like the Thian Hock Keng temple, superlative shopping (including gargantuan malls) and numerous beaches.Read moreVaranasiThe north Indian city of Varanasi, or Benares, is regarded as sacred by Hindus, Buddhists and Jains. Situated in the fertile Ganga valley and on the banks of the Ganges, Varanasi is a place of pilgrimage for Hindus, who come to bathe in the holy river. Known as the City of Temples and a beacon of culture, Varanasi has produced many renowned writers. It’s also a centre of silk weaving, so practise haggling at the chaotic bazaar for some beautiful souvenirs. Rickshaws are the best way to get about.Read moreNew DelhiLaid out by British architect Edwin Lutyens, the Indian capital is a striking modern metropolis. A gracious contrast to Old Delhi's winding streets, the grand avenues and stately buildings of New Delhi are rich with history and culture, from Gandhi's Delhi home (and the site of his assassination) to the tomb of Humayun, a complex of Mughal buildings reminiscent of the Taj Mahal. Chaotic traffic is best left to the locals. Negotiate a good price for taxis or travel on the new Delhi Metro.Read moreUdaipurUdaipur, known as the Venice of the East, boasts several sparkling lakes against a backdrop of the Aravail hills. Jag Niwas and Jag Mandir, islands in Fateh Sagar Lake, are the site of Udaipur Solar Observatory and Nehru Garden. Famous palaces include the magical Lake Palace, now a luxurious five-star hotel, and the massive City Palace on Pichola’s east bank, featuring epic courtyards and stunning paintings.Read morePondicherryBlossoming bougainvilleas, crumbling cathedrals on leafy boulevards and 18th-century colonial buildings colour the former French colony of Pondy, which sits on the Bay of Bengal. But it's also unmistakably Indian, with colourful festivals throughout the year, several mosques and the Sri Aurobindo Ashram. Quiet beaches stretch north and south from town, good for swimming and sunrise strolls. Pondy is a popular weekend getaway destination from Chennai and is easy to navigate on foot or by bicycle.Read moreMumbaiMumbai (formerly known as Bombay), India, is famous for its chaotic streets. For bargains and people-watching, outdoor bazaars top the list of attractions. Popular waterfront destinations are Marine Drive, where visitors go to watch the sun set over the Arabian Sea, and the carnival-like Juhu Beach. More sightseeing options are the Gandhi Museum, in the leader's former home, and the cave temples of Elephanta Island. For tranquillity, Mumbai has many religious sites, lakes and parks.Read moreOoty (Udhagamandalam)Popularly referred to as Ooty, this gem among southern hill resorts is covered in eucalyptus and pine trees and coffee and tea plantations. On a clear day, it's possible to see as far as the Mysore plateau from Dodabetta Peak, the district's most prominent viewpoint. The Stone House, a landmark 1822 bungalow, and St. Stephen's Church are remnants of the area's first British settlement. Also noteworthy: formal botanical gardens, a children's mini-garden and a contemporary art collection.Read moreGoaEast meets West in this sun-soaked state, where Indian culture intertwines with Portuguese influences left over from a 500-year occupation. The beaches have long served as a magnet for serene hedonists. To the north, the tourist-centric scene is prevalent, with an international flair that is now skewing more hip than hippie. Travel south for stretches of unspoiled sand and an escape from large resorts. Temples, mosques and wildlife sanctuaries provide diversions from the beach.Read morePrayagrajRead more[{\"@context\":\"http:\\u002F\\u002Fschema.org\",\"@type\":\"LocalBusiness\",\"name\":\"Singapore\",\"description\":\"\",\"url\":\"\",\"image\":\"https:\\u002F\\u002Fdynamic-media-cdn.tripadvisor.com\\u002Fmedia\\u002Fphoto-o\\u002F15\\u002F33\\u002Ffc\\u002Fb1\\u002Fsingapore.jpg?w=600&h=400&s=1\",\"address\":{\"@type\":\"PostalAddress\",\"addressCountry\":\"\",\"addressLocality\":\"\",\"addressRegion\":\"\",\"postalCode\":\"\",\"streetAddress\":\"\"}},{\"@context\":\"http:\\u002F\\u002Fschema.org\",\"@type\":\"LocalBusiness\",\"name\":\"Varanasi\",\"description\":\"\",\"url\":\"\",\"image\":\"https:\\u002F\\u002Fdynamic-media-cdn.tripadvisor.com\\u002Fmedia\\u002Fphoto-o\\u002F0a\\u002Fbe\\u002F17\\u002F41\\u002Fcaption.jpg?w=600&h=400&s=1\",\"address\":{\"@type\":\"PostalAddress\",\"addressCountry\":\"\",\"addressLocality\":\"\",\"addressRegion\":\"\",\"postalCode\":\"\",\"streetAddress\":\"\"}},{\"@context\":\"http:\\u002F\\u002Fschema.org\",\"@type\":\"LocalBusiness\",\"name\":\"New Delhi\",\"description\":\"\",\"url\":\"\",\"image\":\"https:\\u002F\\u002Fdynamic-media-cdn.tripadvisor.com\\u002Fmedia\\u002Fphoto-o\\u002F24\\u002F03\\u002F3f\\u002Ffd\\u002Fcaption.jpg?w=600&h=400&s=1&cx=2294&cy=1952&chk=v1_c3b28b866491ff3722ce\",\"address\":{\"@type\":\"PostalAddress\",\"addressCountry\":\"\",\"addressLocality\":\"\",\"addressRegion\":\"\",\"postalCode\":\"\",\"streetAddress\":\"\"}},{\"@context\":\"http:\\u002F\\u002Fschema.org\",\"@type\":\"LocalBusiness\",\"name\":\"Udaipur\",\"description\":\"\",\"url\":\"\",\"image\":\"https:\\u002F\\u002Fdynamic-media-cdn.tripadvisor.com\\u002Fmedia\\u002Fphoto-o\\u002F01\\u002Fd3\\u002F67\\u002Fe4\\u002Fsas-bahu.jpg?w=600&h=400&s=1\",\"address\":{\"@type\":\"PostalAddress\",\"addressCountry\":\"\",\"addressLocality\":\"\",\"addressRegion\":\"\",\"postalCode\":\"\",\"streetAddress\":\"\"}},{\"@context\":\"http:\\u002F\\u002Fschema.org\",\"@type\":\"LocalBusiness\",\"name\":\"Pondicherry\",\"description\":\"\",\"url\":\"\",\"image\":\"https:\\u002F\\u002Fdynamic-media-cdn.tripadvisor.com\\u002Fmedia\\u002Fphoto-o\\u002F11\\u002Ff4\\u002F3b\\u002F43\\u002Fboating.jpg?w=600&h=400&s=1\",\"address\":{\"@type\":\"PostalAddress\",\"addressCountry\":\"\",\"addressLocality\":\"\",\"addressRegion\":\"\",\"postalCode\":\"\",\"streetAddress\":\"\"}},{\"@context\":\"http:\\u002F\\u002Fschema.org\",\"@type\":\"LocalBusiness\",\"name\":\"Mumbai\",\"description\":\"\",\"url\":\"\",\"image\":\"https:\\u002F\\u002Fdynamic-media-cdn.tripadvisor.com\\u002Fmedia\\u002Fphoto-o\\u002F0b\\u002F4e\\u002F55\\u002Fe6\\u002Fchhatrapati-shivaji-terminus.jpg?w=600&h=400&s=1\",\"address\":{\"@type\":\"PostalAddress\",\"addressCountry\":\"\",\"addressLocality\":\"\",\"addressRegion\":\"\",\"postalCode\":\"\",\"streetAddress\":\"\"}},{\"@context\":\"http:\\u002F\\u002Fschema.org\",\"@type\":\"LocalBusiness\",\"name\":\"Ooty (Udhagamandalam)\",\"description\":\"\",\"url\":\"\",\"image\":\"https:\\u002F\\u002Fdynamic-media-cdn.tripadvisor.com\\u002Fmedia\\u002Fphoto-o\\u002F0a\\u002F84\\u002F3c\\u002Fbc\\u002Fupper-bhavani-lake.jpg?w=600&h=400&s=1\",\"address\":{\"@type\":\"PostalAddress\",\"addressCountry\":\"\",\"addressLocality\":\"\",\"addressRegion\":\"\",\"postalCode\":\"\",\"streetAddress\":\"\"}},{\"@context\":\"http:\\u002F\\u002Fschema.org\",\"@type\":\"LocalBusiness\",\"name\":\"Goa\",\"description\":\"\",\"url\":\"\",\"image\":\"https:\\u002F\\u002Fdynamic-media-cdn.tripadvisor.com\\u002Fmedia\\u002Fphoto-o\\u002F15\\u002F33\\u002Ffc\\u002Ff0\\u002Fgoa.jpg?w=600&h=400&s=1\",\"address\":{\"@type\":\"PostalAddress\",\"addressCountry\":\"\",\"addressLocality\":\"\",\"addressRegion\":\"\",\"postalCode\":\"\",\"streetAddress\":\"\"}},{\"@context\":\"http:\\u002F\\u002Fschema.org\",\"@type\":\"LocalBusiness\",\"name\":\"Prayagraj\",\"description\":\"\",\"url\":\"\",\"image\":\"https:\\u002F\\u002Fdynamic-media-cdn.tripadvisor.com\\u002Fmedia\\u002Fphoto-o\\u002F0f\\u002Fae\\u002Fb4\\u002F68\\u002Ffort-on-the-side.jpg?w=600&h=400&s=1\",\"address\":{\"@type\":\"PostalAddress\",\"addressCountry\":\"\",\"addressLocality\":\"\",\"addressRegion\":\"\",\"postalCode\":\"\",\"streetAddress\":\"\"}}]Popular Kyoto CategoriesDowntown HotelsHotels with KitchenetteHotels with Free BreakfastHotels with ShuttleBoutique HotelsHistoric HotelsUnique HotelsHotels with Breakfast BuffetHotels with Smoking RoomsHoneymoon HotelsCheap Hotels informationCheap Hotels Kyoto32Cheap Hotels Prices From₹3,472Cheap Hotels Reviews18,500Cheap Hotels Photos14,767Frequently Asked Questions about cheap hotelsWhat are the best cheap hotels near Kiyomizu-dera Temple?Some of the more popular cheap hotels near Kiyomizu-dera Temple include:Mume -

Once at gate when time to board, had to take standing room bus to the tarmac to board. Did not like getting out to plane and having to wait 5 minutes until they opened bus door.\nThis flight was leg 2 of 2 leg journey. The staff at baggage re-drop in Tokyo were fabulous. Once at gate when time to board, had to take standing room bus to the tarmac to board. Did not like getting out to plane and having to wait 5 minutes until they opened bus door.\nFirst experience with JAL so was okay to pretty good. 10 hour flight in premium select seat. . Seats in that category should be better than pretty good. Seat pan a little short for tall people but plenty of leg room; I think JAL in process of new planes? Also, — they could have offered a bit more water throughout flight and meals not the greatest. That said, certainly 200 percent better than a very recent AK Air International flight in similar cabin class in comfort and meals.\nIt's a domestic flight, but still the JAL quality shone through. The crew were polite and helpful and even prepared little gifts / souvenirs for the children on the flight, and everyone got a simple drink. The free wifi for entertainment on the personal device was also a great boon, and the shows surprisingly decent. Would recommend.\nWe ordered for non vegetarian Hindu meal but instead they served us vegetarian Hindu meal. That was also not good. It was very annoying and aggravating. Hope our return from Tokyo to jfk on March 27 same is not repeated. Caterar should understand difference between non vegetarian Hindu meal and vegetarian Hindu meal.\nAllow gold card holders (Group 1) to board with their guest like other One World carriers do\nChecked baggage process is confusing and time consuming especially when checking oversized bags. Very slow agents didn't help.\nFood was great, Entertainment was bad, movies were not current and just did not have good variety. Granted I was tired so cranky might have played into my evaluation. Overall based on cost I definitely would fly them again. I am a million mile flyer on another airline, the service on JAL really beats all airlines.\nThe team members are extremely attentive to make sure you have the best experience.\nWas in premium economy. It is slightly better than economy, but the way the seat reclines actually makes it harder to sit (the seat slides forward and the foot rest comes up - you can lie fairly well reclined but you’ll have to sit cross legged because there is no place for your legs to stretch out. Food is basic economy. Service was great. All in all good, but may make more sense to pay more for business or save a bit and just sit in economy.\nSeats in \"Premium Economy\" were noticeably more comfortable than those in \"Economy\" and worth the price. My only reservation is that the foot rest did not go higher up. If it did, it would have made the seat much more comfortable.\nThis was the best airline I’ve ever taken. The staff are amazing. The food was great. The pilot was phenomenal. I would highly recommend this airline.\nThere wasn't much entertainment for my short flight but the onboarding process was smooth and the crew provided wonderful service. The seats were also reasonably comfy. Great flight.\nI had to get rerouted because the weather delayed my flight enough to miss both of my connecting flights. I select nearly 2 hours on customer service trying to get rerouted and had to miss my first plane which took my luggage to San Francisco. Luckily, customer service sent me to the same airport but I had to ride 12 hours in economy after I paid extra for premium economy. Totally sucks that I overpaid. Customer service and airplane crew were great and really helpful though. Although I still hate how small the seat was, especially since I'm smaller than average, I can't imagine how much it would suck for an average sized person.\nCabin crew were excellent in taking care of my mom as she boarded the aircraft from her wheelchair. Did not care much for the food served.\nI stopped flying with United back in the nineties. Today's experience reminded me of why.\nGreat airline all together - triple 7 for a short flight was a plus - lots of room\nWonderfully pleasant experience. Good meal and beverage selections. Professional air staff.\nSeat width can be a bit wider. not nice that they charge extra for the window seats. online check in can be greatly improved. in other words, their online interface is bad.\nSeat width can be a bit wider. not nice that they charge extra for the window seats.\nSeats were comfortable with excellent legroom. Meals were also quite good. The cabin crew were excellent and very helpful. The check-in experience was also very smooth.\nMost relaxing long distance flight I have been on. And I have flown on many.\nNot great, will likely try to fly another or maybe I should have upgraded my ticket? Needed Air…\nI don’t think I’ll be flying them again. Tight seats, no flowing air or air nozzles that you can turn air on you, for those who could have motion sickness this would be your worst nightmare. The pilot was great and experienced (which is what you want when flying 12 hours) overall I’m thankful knowledgeable pilots!\nMy ticket did not indication which group I was in for boarding; the gate attended help me\nVery routh cabin crew food is only 2 meals for 13 hours fry with them They should get better training how to service good super routh language and talking with customer\nstaff are super nice and effiecient! It was a very comfortable and relaxing flight\nBoarding could have been a little bit better but other than that it was a pretty good experience. I think because of the stowaway to Paris France recently they are being extra diligent about boarding passes at the gate. But they boarded the back of the plane first, and that's something I really think needs to start in the USA.\nI was ordered vegetarian food, but didn't services to me :(\nI did not take the flight, tried to cancel it right after I booked it, but was unable to reach anyone. I blame Kayak for this situation because they sent the booking through another company and I was unable to get anyone to talk to me about the situation. I had to just take the hit and pay for another flight through Cathay Pacific, which was wonderful. I will never use Kayak again. (I bet they don’t post this review!) I’ll just post about them on social media sites. I don’t want anyone to have to go through the hassle and expense I dealt with.\nAirline itself is great. While food was being taken off of my tray my beer spilled which was a total accident and I wasn’t upset about that, what was frustrating was I had to ask for towels to clean up and wipe my leg. It would have been left as is if I hadn’t.\nThe seats felt very small. We were supplied with pillows and blankets, which was nice. Lots of noise from the bathroom, plus exterior noise. Made it hard to hear the entertainment system, even using my own noise-cancelling headphones. The food was really bad. I generally request a vegetarian meal and one was supplied, but the pasta was cold and hard and there was nothing pleasant about it. Two meals were served on this flight; one was a repeat of the meal I had had on the flight immediately preceding this one, which was bad enough I didn't even try it. Drinks were very limited. All I wanted was water, and on a 10.5 hour flight, I was given 3 cups of about 3 ounces each.\nThe seats felt very small. We were supplied with pillows and blankets, which was nice.

I generally request a vegetarian meal and one was supplied, but the pasta was cold and hard and there was nothing pleasant about it. Drinks were very limited. All I wanted was water, and on a 4 hour flight, I was given 2 cups of about 3 ounces each.\nEverything was perfect. A flight attendant even brought me snacks after I declined food due to my desire to force myself to follow the destination time zone.\nFor the most part, it was an enjoyable experience. It's the 2nd half of the journey was a bit uncomfortable. It was on a noticable smaller plane compared to the previous one.\nOnly process that my luggage didn’t make it to my destination because of short connection but I understand\nThe boarding process was good. The toilet could be better maintained.\nThis has been the worst experience I've ever had. We arrived to Ho Chi Minh Airport and were supposed to get our Asiana ticket from the transfer counter as we came with a different airline. However, the staff at the transfer counter were not helpful and kept giving us different information. We were first told by Asiana airlines staff we had to wait 2 hours so they could print out and give us our tickets, then someone else told us we had to wait 3hrs, someone told us \"I don't know, just go sit and wait and we will tell you later.\" This was at a place in the Ho Chi Minh airport that had no coffee or food shops, nothing, just immigration (to enter Vietnam with a Vietnam Visa) and security (to transfer into the gates) but we needed our printed boarding pass to go through. It wasn't until we demanded to speak to a supervisor as our flight time was 1hr away because they kept telling us \"there's alot of time left for your international flight, we will get your tickets later\" we still had to wait around 20minutes for the \"Supervisor\" to give us our tickets. I would NOT recommend Asiana Airlines, especially if going thru Ho Chi Minh Airport as they are not helpful. (We almost missed our flight, due to their lazyness and incompetence of printing our tickets) I would suggest Asiana Airlines to have a Machine in the transfer area so passengers can easily print out their boarding passes themselves and save some money by not hiring incompetent staff that can't do a simple task such as printing a boarding pass.\nGreat service. They could offer vegetarian food and do more to reduce waste.\nI like the food, the crew and everything.!!! Except for the delay in our flight.\nGreat service and comfortable seats. The first meal was excellent but the second meal was only satisfactory\nEverything went smoothly. I appreciate the selection of free movies.\nI like the friendliness of the crew members. I think the snack could’ve been better instead of a small package of pretzel. I like that they offer me something to drink.\nThe TSA agents in Phoenix were incredibly rude and confiscated belongings that we wanted to check. The flight got changed without our knowledge to a worse situation. The whole thing was terrible\nAir Canada was great! From the airport at Montreal to boarding to the food on board the plane. The crew was great too! There was a slight issue with some other peoples’ tickets that I overheard about but the crew handled with care immediately to ensure everyone was comfortable and we could takeoff! Great experience with Air Canada\nMy experience with Air Canada was good. Great customer service… only a few delays and issues with the tunnel to exit the plain. I did not appreciate that we arrived at terminal D and had to go to terminal E to get the bags/ luggage.\nPDX staff was great and we arrived on time in YVR.\nThey announced before boarding that the flight was full and there would be limited space in the overhead bins and you could check in for free. We did and after we boarded the plane found it was not full and there was plenty of space in the overhead bins. I’m not sure why they made this announcement.\nFront desk attendant wouldn’t check me in even though there was not a single person in line. Made me use the kiosk. Kiosk had an error (of course) no baggage can be checked at this kiosk please see attendant. Then I had to wait in line for the same front desk attendant waiting for 5 people who ended up coming in front of me while I tried to use a broken and useless kiosk. Finally after checked in, wait 30 min to board all the way to zone 6 and they would deny me even after all the zone 1-5 people already went. Just literally making us wait to board so they stand there doing nothing for 5 minutes. Just ridiculous and awful customer service. Fly with literally anyone else\nThey are a great airline, and i enjoying flying with them. However my experience with booking through Kayak was a horrible experience. With all the restrictions and glitches of website. My entire bookings by kayak was wrong. And there was no possible way of fixing anything with them, because they hand over responsibility to the airline after purchase is made. Will not be booking through Kayak again and will inform my family and friends not to as well.\nAll was good with comfort and ease of boarding. There was confusion from what gate to board at. Meant moving a long distance but I allowed plenty of time for this.\nNot what you’re looking for?

In 2010, festivities are in the works to celebrate this ancient city's anniversary. \"Old Japan\" is still easy to spot here, from Great Buddha Hall to traditional ryokans and the serene Isuien garden. travellers rave about walking tours of Nara, particularly in the historic Naramachi merchant area.Read more\nHigashiomiRead more\nOsakaHome to nearly nine million and powering an economy that exceeds both Hong Kong's and Thailand's, Osaka packs quite a punch.

(Just make sure you heed the local laws—something like spitting in the street might merely be considered rude in your hometown, but here, it carries a severe penalty.) You'll find historic sites like the Thian Hock Keng temple, superlative shopping (including gargantuan malls) and numerous beaches.Read more\nVaranasiThe north Indian city of Varanasi, or Benares, is regarded as sacred by Hindus, Buddhists and Jains. Situated in the fertile Ganga valley and on the banks of the Ganges, Varanasi is a place of pilgrimage for Hindus, who come to bathe in the holy river. Known as the City of Temples and a beacon of culture, Varanasi has produced many renowned writers. It’s also a centre of silk weaving, so practise haggling at the chaotic bazaar for some beautiful souvenirs. Rickshaws are the best way to get about.Read more\nNew DelhiLaid out by British architect Edwin Lutyens, the Indian capital is a striking modern metropolis. A gracious contrast to Old Delhi's winding streets, the grand avenues and stately buildings of New Delhi are rich with history and culture, from Gandhi's Delhi home (and the site of his assassination) to the tomb of Humayun, a complex of Mughal buildings reminiscent of the Taj Mahal. Chaotic traffic is best left to the locals. Negotiate a good price for taxis or travel on the new Delhi Metro.Read more\nUdaipurUdaipur, known as the Venice of the East, boasts several sparkling lakes against a backdrop of the Aravail hills.

But it's also unmistakably Indian, with colourful festivals throughout the year, several mosques and the Sri Aurobindo Ashram. Quiet beaches stretch north and south from town, good for swimming and sunrise strolls.

For bargains and people-watching, outdoor bazaars top the list of attractions. Popular waterfront destinations are Marine Drive, where visitors go to watch the sun set over the Arabian Sea, and the carnival-like Juhu Beach. More sightseeing options are the Gandhi Museum, in the leader's former home, and the cave temples of Elephanta Island. For tranquillity, Mumbai has many religious sites, lakes and parks.Read more\nOoty (Udhagamandalam)Popularly referred to as Ooty, this gem among southern hill resorts is covered in eucalyptus and pine trees and coffee and tea plantations.

The Stone House, a landmark 1822 bungalow, and St. Stephen's Church are remnants of the area's first British settlement.

The beaches have long served as a magnet for serene hedonists. To the north, the tourist-centric scene is prevalent, with an international flair that is now skewing more hip than hippie. Travel south for stretches of unspoiled sand and an escape from large resorts.

(Just make sure you heed the local laws—something like spitting in the street might merely be considered rude in your hometown, but here, it carries a severe penalty.) You'll find historic sites like the Thian Hock Keng temple, superlative shopping (including gargantuan malls) and numerous beaches.Read moreVaranasiThe north Indian city of Varanasi, or Benares, is regarded as sacred by Hindus, Buddhists and Jains. Situated in the fertile Ganga valley and on the banks of the Ganges, Varanasi is a place of pilgrimage for Hindus, who come to bathe in the holy river. Known as the City of Temples and a beacon of culture, Varanasi has produced many renowned writers. It’s also a centre of silk weaving, so practise haggling at the chaotic bazaar for some beautiful souvenirs. Rickshaws are the best way to get about.Read moreNew DelhiLaid out by British architect Edwin Lutyens, the Indian capital is a striking modern metropolis. A gracious contrast to Old Delhi's winding streets, the grand avenues and stately buildings of New Delhi are rich with history and culture, from Gandhi's Delhi home (and the site of his assassination) to the tomb of Humayun, a complex of Mughal buildings reminiscent of the Taj Mahal. Chaotic traffic is best left to the locals. Negotiate a good price for taxis or travel on the new Delhi Metro.Read moreUdaipurUdaipur, known as the Venice of the East, boasts several sparkling lakes against a backdrop of the Aravail hills. Jag Niwas and Jag Mandir, islands in Fateh Sagar Lake, are the site of Udaipur Solar Observatory and Nehru Garden. Famous palaces include the magical Lake Palace, now a luxurious five-star hotel, and the massive City Palace on Pichola’s east bank, featuring epic courtyards and stunning paintings.Read morePondicherryBlossoming bougainvilleas, crumbling cathedrals on leafy boulevards and 18th-century colonial buildings colour the former French colony of Pondy, which sits on the Bay of Bengal. But it's also unmistakably Indian, with colourful festivals throughout the year, several mosques and the Sri Aurobindo Ashram. Quiet beaches stretch north and south from town, good for swimming and sunrise strolls. Pondy is a popular weekend getaway destination from Chennai and is easy to navigate on foot or by bicycle.Read moreMumbaiMumbai (formerly known as Bombay), India, is famous for its chaotic streets. For bargains and people-watching, outdoor bazaars top the list of attractions. Popular waterfront destinations are Marine Drive, where visitors go to watch the sun set over the Arabian Sea, and the carnival-like Juhu Beach. More sightseeing options are the Gandhi Museum, in the leader's former home, and the cave temples of Elephanta Island. For tranquillity, Mumbai has many religious sites, lakes and parks.Read moreOoty (Udhagamandalam)Popularly referred to as Ooty, this gem among southern hill resorts is covered in eucalyptus and pine trees and coffee and tea plantations. On a clear day, it's possible to see as far as the Mysore plateau from Dodabetta Peak, the district's most prominent viewpoint. The Stone House, a landmark 1822 bungalow, and St. Stephen's Church are remnants of the area's first British settlement. Also noteworthy: formal botanical gardens, a children's mini-garden and a contemporary art collection.Read moreGoaEast meets West in this sun-soaked state, where Indian culture intertwines with Portuguese influences left over from a 500-year occupation. The beaches have long served as a magnet for serene hedonists. To the north, the tourist-centric scene is prevalent, with an international flair that is now skewing more hip than hippie. Travel south for stretches of unspoiled sand and an escape from large resorts. Temples, mosques and wildlife sanctuaries provide diversions from the beach.Read morePrayagrajRead more[{\"@context\":\"http:\\u002F\\u002Fschema.org\",\"@type\":\"LocalBusiness\",\"name\":\"Singapore\",\"description\":\"\",\"url\":\"\",\"image\":\"https:\\u002F\\u002Fdynamic-media-cdn.tripadvisor.com\\u002Fmedia\\u002Fphoto-o\\u002F15\\u002F33\\u002Ffc\\u002Fb1\\u002Fsingapore.jpg?w=600&h=400&s=1\",\"address\":{\"@type\":\"PostalAddress\",\"addressCountry\":\"\",\"addressLocality\":\"\",\"addressRegion\":\"\",\"postalCode\":\"\",\"streetAddress\":\"\"}},{\"@context\":\"http:\\u002F\\u002Fschema.org\",\"@type\":\"LocalBusiness\",\"name\":\"Varanasi\",\"description\":\"\",\"url\":\"\",\"image\":\"https:\\u002F\\u002Fdynamic-media-cdn.tripadvisor.com\\u002Fmedia\\u002Fphoto-o\\u002F0a\\u002Fbe\\u002F17\\u002F41\\u002Fcaption.jpg?w=600&h=400&s=1\",\"address\":{\"@type\":\"PostalAddress\",\"addressCountry\":\"\",\"addressLocality\":\"\",\"addressRegion\":\"\",\"postalCode\":\"\",\"streetAddress\":\"\"}},{\"@context\":\"http:\\u002F\\u002Fschema.org\",\"@type\":\"LocalBusiness\",\"name\":\"New Delhi\",\"description\":\"\",\"url\":\"\",\"image\":\"https:\\u002F\\u002Fdynamic-media-cdn.tripadvisor.com\\u002Fmedia\\u002Fphoto-o\\u002F24\\u002F03\\u002F3f\\u002Ffd\\u002Fcaption.jpg?w=600&h=400&s=1&cx=2294&cy=1952&chk=v1_c3b28b866491ff3722ce\",\"address\":{\"@type\":\"PostalAddress\",\"addressCountry\":\"\",\"addressLocality\":\"\",\"addressRegion\":\"\",\"postalCode\":\"\",\"streetAddress\":\"\"}},{\"@context\":\"http:\\u002F\\u002Fschema.org\",\"@type\":\"LocalBusiness\",\"name\":\"Udaipur\",\"description\":\"\",\"url\":\"\",\"image\":\"https:\\u002F\\u002Fdynamic-media-cdn.tripadvisor.com\\u002Fmedia\\u002Fphoto-o\\u002F01\\u002Fd3\\u002F67\\u002Fe4\\u002Fsas-bahu.jpg?w=600&h=400&s=1\",\"address\":{\"@type\":\"PostalAddress\",\"addressCountry\":\"\",\"addressLocality\":\"\",\"addressRegion\":\"\",\"postalCode\":\"\",\"streetAddress\":\"\"}},{\"@context\":\"http:\\u002F\\u002Fschema.org\",\"@type\":\"LocalBusiness\",\"name\":\"Pondicherry\",\"description\":\"\",\"url\":\"\",\"image\":\"https:\\u002F\\u002Fdynamic-media-cdn.tripadvisor.com\\u002Fmedia\\u002Fphoto-o\\u002F11\\u002Ff4\\u002F3b\\u002F43\\u002Fboating.jpg?w=600&h=400&s=1\",\"address\":{\"@type\":\"PostalAddress\",\"addressCountry\":\"\",\"addressLocality\":\"\",\"addressRegion\":\"\",\"postalCode\":\"\",\"streetAddress\":\"\"}},{\"@context\":\"http:\\u002F\\u002Fschema.org\",\"@type\":\"LocalBusiness\",\"name\":\"Mumbai\",\"description\":\"\",\"url\":\"\",\"image\":\"https:\\u002F\\u002Fdynamic-media-cdn.tripadvisor.com\\u002Fmedia\\u002Fphoto-o\\u002F0b\\u002F4e\\u002F55\\u002Fe6\\u002Fchhatrapati-shivaji-terminus.jpg?w=600&h=400&s=1\",\"address\":{\"@type\":\"PostalAddress\",\"addressCountry\":\"\",\"addressLocality\":\"\",\"addressRegion\":\"\",\"postalCode\":\"\",\"streetAddress\":\"\"}},{\"@context\":\"http:\\u002F\\u002Fschema.org\",\"@type\":\"LocalBusiness\",\"name\":\"Ooty (Udhagamandalam)\",\"description\":\"\",\"url\":\"\",\"image\":\"https:\\u002F\\u002Fdynamic-media-cdn.tripadvisor.com\\u002Fmedia\\u002Fphoto-o\\u002F0a\\u002F84\\u002F3c\\u002Fbc\\u002Fupper-bhavani-lake.jpg?w=600&h=400&s=1\",\"address\":{\"@type\":\"PostalAddress\",\"addressCountry\":\"\",\"addressLocality\":\"\",\"addressRegion\":\"\",\"postalCode\":\"\",\"streetAddress\":\"\"}},{\"@context\":\"http:\\u002F\\u002Fschema.org\",\"@type\":\"LocalBusiness\",\"name\":\"Goa\",\"description\":\"\",\"url\":\"\",\"image\":\"https:\\u002F\\u002Fdynamic-media-cdn.tripadvisor.com\\u002Fmedia\\u002Fphoto-o\\u002F15\\u002F33\\u002Ffc\\u002Ff0\\u002Fgoa.jpg?w=600&h=400&s=1\",\"address\":{\"@type\":\"PostalAddress\",\"addressCountry\":\"\",\"addressLocality\":\"\",\"addressRegion\":\"\",\"postalCode\":\"\",\"streetAddress\":\"\"}},{\"@context\":\"http:\\u002F\\u002Fschema.org\",\"@type\":\"LocalBusiness\",\"name\":\"Prayagraj\",\"description\":\"\",\"url\":\"\",\"image\":\"https:\\u002F\\u002Fdynamic-media-cdn.tripadvisor.com\\u002Fmedia\\u002Fphoto-o\\u002F0f\\u002Fae\\u002Fb4\\u002F68\\u002Ffort-on-the-side.jpg?w=600&h=400&s=1\",\"address\":{\"@type\":\"PostalAddress\",\"addressCountry\":\"\",\"addressLocality\":\"\",\"addressRegion\":\"\",\"postalCode\":\"\",\"streetAddress\":\"\"}}]Popular Kyoto CategoriesDowntown HotelsHotels with KitchenetteHotels with Free BreakfastHotels with ShuttleBoutique HotelsHistoric HotelsUnique HotelsHotels with Breakfast BuffetHotels with Smoking RoomsHoneymoon HotelsCheap Hotels informationCheap Hotels Kyoto32Cheap Hotels Prices From₹3,472Cheap Hotels Reviews18,500Cheap Hotels Photos14,767Frequently Asked Questions about cheap hotelsWhat are the best cheap hotels near Kiyomizu-dera Temple?Some of the more popular cheap hotels near Kiyomizu-dera Temple include:Mume -
