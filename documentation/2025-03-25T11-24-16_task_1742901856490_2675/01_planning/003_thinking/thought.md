## Thought Process

To begin planning a 7-day trip, I need to establish a clear structure for the itinerary. This involves several key components:

1. **Destination Selection**: Determine the destination(s) for the trip based on potential interests or popular travel locations.
2. **Daily Itinerary**: Plan activities, sights, and experiences for each day.
3. **Logistics**: Consider travel arrangements between locations, if applicable.
4. **Accommodations**: Recommend places to stay based on location and preferences.
5. **Meals and Cuisine**: Suggest local dining options and cuisine experiences.
6. **Cost Estimation**: Provide an estimated budget for the trip.
7. **Booking Requirements**: Note any important reservations or bookings needed.

### Current Focus: Destination Selection

**Reasoning**: The first step is to choose a destination or multiple destinations for the trip. This will guide the rest of the planning process, including activities, accommodations, and logistics.

**Information Needed**:
- Popular travel destinations or themes (e.g., beach, city, adventure).
- User preferences, if any, regarding climate, activities, or specific interests.

**Plan**:
1. Conduct a web search to identify popular travel destinations for a 7-day trip.
2. Gather information on each destination's highlights, climate, and travel feasibility.

Once I have this information, I can proceed to outline a daily itinerary and other components of the trip plan. I will now perform a web search to gather information on popular travel destinations.
