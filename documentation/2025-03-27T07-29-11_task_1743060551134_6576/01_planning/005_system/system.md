  "feedback": "The execution of the step to search for flights from Seattle to Japan (Tokyo or Osaka) within the budget of $2500-5000 for two people resulted in partial information. While the search identified several potential sources for flight information, it did not extract specific flight details such as prices, airlines, or exact itineraries. This lack of detailed information means that the step did not fully meet its success criteria, which was to identify at least two flight options that fit the budget and travel dates."
