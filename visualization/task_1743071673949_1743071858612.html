If you buy something, we may earn an affiliate commission.\n\nJapan comprises a whole host of personalities and guises. Perhaps it’s the multitude of islands surrounding the mainland that make it so eclectic, or the landscape, which spans inner city, vast forestry and expansive sandy shorelines. There’s so much to do and see that visiting just once seems insufficient, albeit extensively rewarding. Fly to Tokyo, and you’re met with larger-than-life skyscrapers, pioneering technology and a city that seemingly never sleeps but moves inland – by train for the full experience – and tranquillity awaits. In contrast, this is the home of forest bathing. Then there’s the culture: the food, the architecture, the overarching values. No matter what kind of a trip you’re looking to book, there’s something unique to uncover when exploring Japan. Here, we list the Japan hotels that promise to elevate your stay just a little bit more.\n\nFor more inspiration on where to stay in Japan, visit:\n\nThe best hotels in Tokyo\nThe best hotels in Kyoto\nThe best Airbnbs in Tokyo\n\nHow we choose the best hotels in Japan\n\nACCORDIONITEMCONTAINERBUTTON\n\nEvery hotel on this list has been selected independently by our editors and written by a Condé Nast Traveller journalist who knows the destination and has stayed at that property. When choosing hotels, our editors consider both luxury properties and boutique and lesser-known boltholes that offer an authentic and insider experience of a destination. We’re always looking for beautiful design, a great location and warm service – as well as serious sustainability credentials.

Where to propose in Japan\nIntro\n\nForget Paris, Japan is the new capital of romance. This achingly beautiful country is the perfect place to pop the question and is infinitely more original than more traditional proposal destinations. Japan is alternative, hip, and will look sensational in photographs when you share your happy news with family and friends. You could even return for the wedding and honeymoon! With Valentine’s Day just around the corner, let’s take a look at the most romantic locations in Japan to ask that question and get the answer you’re looking for you. We’ll run you through our Top 10 and tell you exactly how to get there using your JR Pass and Japan’s ever-reliable rail network. All you need next is the ring! \n\nTop 10 Most Romantic Proposal Spots in Japan\n\nWhen it comes to proposing, it’s not just about finding the most romantic, beautiful or spectacular location of course, it’s also about the right moment. Similarly, if you’re getting down on one knee in a very popular public place, timing is everything. You definitely don’t want somewhere too busy or overcrowded so it’s worth considering the best time of day (and even the best time of year) to avoid the crowds. The likes of Cherry Blossom season (late March/early April) for instance, while undoubtedly beautiful and very romantic, is also the single busiest time of year with millions of extra visitors to Japan. The first few days of New Year’s Day are also very busy as Japanese people visit temples and shrines across the country. Golden Week – Japan’s week of national holidays – is another time when the country may seem busier than usual as many residents will be off work. And of course, in 2020, there’s also the small matter of the Olympics too – although if you and your partner are sports fans then maybe this would be the perfect time to propose?!

If you buy something, we may earn an affiliate commission.\n\nJapan comprises a whole host of personalities and guises. Perhaps it’s the multitude of islands surrounding the mainland that make it so eclectic, or the landscape, which spans inner city, vast forestry and expansive sandy shorelines. There’s so much to do and see that visiting just once seems insufficient, albeit extensively rewarding. Fly to Tokyo, and you’re met with larger-than-life skyscrapers, pioneering technology and a city that seemingly never sleeps but moves inland – by train for the full experience – and tranquillity awaits.

And of course, in 2020, there’s also the small matter of the Olympics too – although if you and your partner are sports fans then maybe this would be the perfect time to propose?!

If you buy something, we may earn an affiliate commission.\n\nJapan comprises a whole host of personalities and guises. Perhaps it’s the multitude of islands surrounding the mainland that make it so eclectic, or the landscape, which spans inner city, vast forestry and expansive sandy shorelines. There’s so much to do and see that visiting just once seems insufficient, albeit extensively rewarding. Fly to Tokyo, and you’re met with larger-than-life skyscrapers, pioneering technology and a city that seemingly never sleeps but moves inland – by train for the full experience – and tranquillity awaits. In contrast, this is the home of forest bathing. Then there’s the culture: the food, the architecture, the overarching values. No matter what kind of a trip you’re looking to book, there’s something unique to uncover when exploring Japan. Here, we list the Japan hotels that promise to elevate your stay just a little bit more.\n\nFor more inspiration on where to stay in Japan, visit:\n\nThe best hotels in Tokyo\nThe best hotels in Kyoto\nThe best Airbnbs in Tokyo\n\nHow we choose the best hotels in Japan\n\nACCORDIONITEMCONTAINERBUTTON\n\nEvery hotel on this list has been selected independently by our editors and written by a Condé Nast Traveller journalist who knows the destination and has stayed at that property. When choosing hotels, our editors consider both luxury properties and boutique and lesser-known boltholes that offer an authentic and insider experience of a destination. We’re always looking for beautiful design, a great location and warm service – as well as serious sustainability credentials.

This achingly beautiful country is the perfect place to pop the question and is infinitely more original than more traditional proposal destinations.

The first few days of New Year’s Day are also very busy as Japanese people visit temples and shrines across the country. Golden Week – Japan’s week of national holidays – is another time when the country may seem busier than usual as many residents will be off work. And of course, in 2020, there’s also the small matter of the Olympics too – although if you and your partner are sports fans then maybe this would be the perfect time to propose?!

If you buy something, we may earn an affiliate commission.\n\nJapan comprises a whole host of personalities and guises. Perhaps it’s the multitude of islands surrounding the mainland that make it so eclectic, or the landscape, which spans inner city, vast forestry and expansive sandy shorelines. There’s so much to do and see that visiting just once seems insufficient, albeit extensively rewarding. Fly to Tokyo, and you’re met with larger-than-life skyscrapers, pioneering technology and a city that seemingly never sleeps but moves inland – by train for the full experience – and tranquillity awaits. In contrast, this is the home of forest bathing. Then there’s the culture: the food, the architecture, the overarching values. No matter what kind of a trip you’re looking to book, there’s something unique to uncover when exploring Japan. Here, we list the Japan hotels that promise to elevate your stay just a little bit more.\n\nFor more inspiration on where to stay in Japan, visit:\n\nThe best hotels in Tokyo\nThe best hotels in Kyoto\nThe best Airbnbs in Tokyo\n\nHow we choose the best hotels in Japan\n\nACCORDIONITEMCONTAINERBUTTON\n\nEvery hotel on this list has been selected independently by our editors and written by a Condé Nast Traveller journalist who knows the destination and has stayed at that property. When choosing hotels, our editors consider both luxury properties and boutique and lesser-known boltholes that offer an authentic and insider experience of a destination. We’re always looking for beautiful design, a great location and warm service – as well as serious sustainability credentials.

Where to propose in Japan\nIntro\n\nForget Paris, Japan is the new capital of romance. This achingly beautiful country is the perfect place to pop the question and is infinitely more original than more traditional proposal destinations. Japan is alternative, hip, and will look sensational in photographs when you share your happy news with family and friends. You could even return for the wedding and honeymoon! With Valentine’s Day just around the corner, let’s take a look at the most romantic locations in Japan to ask that question and get the answer you’re looking for you.

All you need next is the ring! \n\nTop 10 Most Romantic Proposal Spots in Japan\n\nWhen it comes to proposing, it’s not just about finding the most romantic, beautiful or spectacular location of course, it’s also about the right moment. Similarly, if you’re getting down on one knee in a very popular public place, timing is everything. You definitely don’t want somewhere too busy or overcrowded so it’s worth considering the best time of day (and even the best time of year) to avoid the crowds. The likes of Cherry Blossom season (late March/early April) for instance, while undoubtedly beautiful and very romantic, is also the single busiest time of year with millions of extra visitors to Japan. The first few days of New Year’s Day are also very busy as Japanese people visit temples and shrines across the country. Golden Week – Japan’s week of national holidays – is another time when the country may seem busier than usual as many residents will be off work. And of course, in 2020, there’s also the small matter of the Olympics too – although if you and your partner are sports fans then maybe this would be the perfect time to propose?!
