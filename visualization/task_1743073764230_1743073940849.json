hidden gems, and cultural experiences in Japan, focusing on kendo, tea ceremonies, Zen meditation, and Nara's deer, I will organize the information as follows:\n\n### 1. Kendo Historical Sites and Experiences\n\n#### Key Locations:\n- **Musashi no Sato**: A historical site related to kendo, detailed on [Kenshi247](https://kenshi247.net/blog/2011/06/20/kendo-places-11-musashi-no-sato/).\n- **Tsuruga-jo Castle, Fukushima**: Offers kendo experiences, as described on [Japan Travel](https://www.japan.travel/en/sg/jbyj-blog/fukushima-kendo-experience-at-tsuruga-jo-castle/).\n- **Kyoto Kendo Experience**: Reviewed on [TripAdvisor](https://www.tripadvisor.in/Attraction_Review-g298564-d12146328-Reviews-Experience_KENDO_in_KYOTO-Kyoto_Kyoto_Prefecture_Kinki.html).\n\n#### Details:\n- **Prices and Schedules**: Typically, kendo experiences can range from ¥3,000 to ¥10,000 depending on the location and duration. It's advisable to check specific websites or contact the venues for up-to-date schedules and booking options.\n\n### 2. Tea Ceremony Experiences\n\n#### Key Locations:\n- **Tokyo Tea Ceremonies**: Information available on [Maikoya](https://mai-ko.com/culture/tea-ceremony/tokyo.html) and [ByFood](https://www.byfood.com/blog/tea-ceremony-tokyo-p-523).\n- **Kyoto Tea Ceremonies**: Detailed on [Tea Kyoto](https://tea-kyoto.com/).\n\n#### Details:\n- **Prices and Options**: Tea ceremonies in Tokyo and Kyoto typically cost between ¥2,000 to ¥5,000. Some experiences include kimono wearing, which may increase the price. Booking in advance is recommended, especially for popular spots.\n\n### 3. Zen Meditation Experiences\n\n#### Key Locations:\n- **General Guide**: [Japan Travel](https://www.japan.travel/en/guide/meditation/) provides a comprehensive guide to meditation experiences.\n- **Tokyo Zen Meditation**: Available at [Toki Tokyo](https://www.toki.tokyo/experience/zen-meditation).\n- **Zazen Meditation**: Offered by [Wabunka Enterprise](https://wabunka-enterprise.com/en/experiences/zazen-meditation).\n\n#### Details:\n- **Prices and Schedules**: Zen meditation sessions can range from ¥1,000 to ¥3,000. Sessions are often held in the mornings or late afternoons. It's best to check individual websites for specific times and to make reservations.\n\n### 4. Nara's Deer and Attractions\n\n#### Key Locations:\n- **Nara Park**: Detailed information can be found on [Visit Nara](https://www.visitnara.jp/destinations/area/nara-park/) and [Japan Guide](https://www.japan-guide.com/e/e4103.html).\n\n#### Details:\n- **Activities and Tips**: Nara Park is famous for its free-roaming deer. Visitors can purchase special deer crackers for feeding. The park is open year-round, and entry is free. It's advisable to visit early in the day to avoid crowds.\n\n### Conclusion\n\nFor a well-rounded cultural experience in Japan, consider combining these activities. For instance, a day could start with a Zen meditation session, followed by a tea ceremony, and end with a kendo experience. When visiting Nara, allocate a full day to explore the park and nearby attractions. Always check for the latest information on prices and availability, and consider booking experiences in advance to secure your spot.\n\n",

Where to propose in Japan\nIntro\n\nForget Paris, Japan is the new capital of romance. This achingly beautiful country is the perfect place to pop the question and is infinitely more original than more traditional proposal destinations. Japan is alternative, hip, and will look sensational in photographs when you share your happy news with family and friends. You could even return for the wedding and honeymoon! With Valentine’s Day just around the corner, let’s take a look at the most romantic locations in Japan to ask that question and get the answer you’re looking for you.

Similarly, if you’re getting down on one knee in a very popular public place, timing is everything. You definitely don’t want somewhere too busy or overcrowded so it’s worth considering the best time of day (and even the best time of year) to avoid the crowds. The likes of Cherry Blossom season (late March/early April) for instance, while undoubtedly beautiful and very romantic, is also the single busiest time of year with millions of extra visitors to Japan. The first few days of New Year’s Day are also very busy as Japanese people visit temples and shrines across the country. Golden Week – Japan’s week of national holidays – is another time when the country may seem busier than usual as many residents will be off work. And of course, in 2020, there’s also the small matter of the Olympics too – although if you and your partner are sports fans then maybe this would be the perfect time to propose?!

hidden gems, and cultural experiences in Japan, focusing on kendo, tea ceremonies, Zen meditation, and Nara's deer, I will organize the information as follows:\n\n### 1. Kendo Historical Sites and Experiences\n\n#### Key Locations:\n- **Musashi no Sato**: A historical site related to kendo, detailed on [Kenshi247](https://kenshi247.net/blog/2011/06/20/kendo-places-11-musashi-no-sato/).\n- **Tsuruga-jo Castle, Fukushima**: Offers kendo experiences, as described on [Japan Travel](https://www.japan.travel/en/sg/jbyj-blog/fukushima-kendo-experience-at-tsuruga-jo-castle/).\n- **Kyoto Kendo Experience**: Reviewed on [TripAdvisor](https://www.tripadvisor.in/Attraction_Review-g298564-d12146328-Reviews-Experience_KENDO_in_KYOTO-Kyoto_Kyoto_Prefecture_Kinki.html).\n\n#### Details:\n- **Prices and Schedules**: Typically, kendo experiences can range from ¥3,000 to ¥10,000 depending on the location and duration. It's advisable to check specific websites or contact the venues for up-to-date schedules and booking options.\n\n### 2. Tea Ceremony Experiences\n\n#### Key Locations:\n- **Tokyo Tea Ceremonies**: Information available on [Maikoya](https://mai-ko.com/culture/tea-ceremony/tokyo.html) and [ByFood](https://www.byfood.com/blog/tea-ceremony-tokyo-p-523).\n- **Kyoto Tea Ceremonies**: Detailed on [Tea Kyoto](https://tea-kyoto.com/).\n\n#### Details:\n- **Prices and Options**: Tea ceremonies in Tokyo and Kyoto typically cost between ¥2,000 to ¥5,000. Some experiences include kimono wearing, which may increase the price. Booking in advance is recommended, especially for popular spots.\n\n### 3. Zen Meditation Experiences\n\n#### Key Locations:\n- **General Guide**: [Japan Travel](https://www.japan.travel/en/guide/meditation/) provides a comprehensive guide to meditation experiences.\n- **Tokyo Zen Meditation**: Available at [Toki Tokyo](https://www.toki.tokyo/experience/zen-meditation).\n- **Zazen Meditation**: Offered by [Wabunka Enterprise](https://wabunka-enterprise.com/en/experiences/zazen-meditation).\n\n#### Details:\n- **Prices and Schedules**: Zen meditation sessions can range from ¥1,000 to ¥3,000. Sessions are often held in the mornings or late afternoons. It's best to check individual websites for specific times and to make reservations.\n\n### 4. Nara's Deer and Attractions\n\n#### Key Locations:\n- **Nara Park**: Detailed information can be found on [Visit Nara](https://www.visitnara.jp/destinations/area/nara-park/) and [Japan Guide](https://www.japan-guide.com/e/e4103.html).\n\n#### Details:\n- **Activities and Tips**: Nara Park is famous for its free-roaming deer. Visitors can purchase special deer crackers for feeding. The park is open year-round, and entry is free. It's advisable to visit early in the day to avoid crowds.\n\n### Conclusion\n\nFor a well-rounded cultural experience in Japan, consider combining these activities. For instance, a day could start with a Zen meditation session, followed by a tea ceremony, and end with a kendo experience. When visiting Nara, allocate a full day to explore the park and nearby attractions. Always check for the latest information on prices and availability, and consider booking experiences in advance to secure your spot.\n\n",

Where to propose in Japan\nIntro\n\nForget Paris, Japan is the new capital of romance. This achingly beautiful country is the perfect place to pop the question and is infinitely more original than more traditional proposal destinations. Japan is alternative, hip, and will look sensational in photographs when you share your happy news with family and friends. You could even return for the wedding and honeymoon! With Valentine’s Day just around the corner, let’s take a look at the most romantic locations in Japan to ask that question and get the answer you’re looking for you.

Similarly, if you’re getting down on one knee in a very popular public place, timing is everything. You definitely don’t want somewhere too busy or overcrowded so it’s worth considering the best time of day (and even the best time of year) to avoid the crowds. The likes of Cherry Blossom season (late March/early April) for instance, while undoubtedly beautiful and very romantic, is also the single busiest time of year with millions of extra visitors to Japan. The first few days of New Year’s Day are also very busy as Japanese people visit temples and shrines across the country. Golden Week – Japan’s week of national holidays – is another time when the country may seem busier than usual as many residents will be off work. And of course, in 2020, there’s also the small matter of the Olympics too – although if you and your partner are sports fans then maybe this would be the perfect time to propose?!

Where to propose in Japan\nIntro\n\nForget Paris, Japan is the new capital of romance. This achingly beautiful country is the perfect place to pop the question and is infinitely more original than more traditional proposal destinations. Japan is alternative, hip, and will look sensational in photographs when you share your happy news with family and friends. You could even return for the wedding and honeymoon! With Valentine’s Day just around the corner, let’s take a look at the most romantic locations in Japan to ask that question and get the answer you’re looking for you. We’ll run you through our Top 10 and tell you exactly how to get there using your JR Pass and Japan’s ever-reliable rail network. All you need next is the ring! \n\nTop 10 Most Romantic Proposal Spots in Japan\n\nWhen it comes to proposing, it’s not just about finding the most romantic, beautiful or spectacular location of course, it’s also about the right moment. Similarly, if you’re getting down on one knee in a very popular public place, timing is everything. You definitely don’t want somewhere too busy or overcrowded so it’s worth considering the best time of day (and even the best time of year) to avoid the crowds. The likes of Cherry Blossom season (late March/early April) for instance, while undoubtedly beautiful and very romantic, is also the single busiest time of year with millions of extra visitors to Japan.

Where to propose in Japan\nIntro\n\nForget Paris, Japan is the new capital of romance. This achingly beautiful country is the perfect place to pop the question and is infinitely more original than more traditional proposal destinations. Japan is alternative, hip, and will look sensational in photographs when you share your happy news with family and friends. You could even return for the wedding and honeymoon! With Valentine’s Day just around the corner, let’s take a look at the most romantic locations in Japan to ask that question and get the answer you’re looking for you. We’ll run you through our Top 10 and tell you exactly how to get there using your JR Pass and Japan’s ever-reliable rail network. All you need next is the ring! \n\nTop 10 Most Romantic Proposal Spots in Japan\n\nWhen it comes to proposing, it’s not just about finding the most romantic, beautiful or spectacular location of course, it’s also about the right moment. Similarly, if you’re getting down on one knee in a very popular public place, timing is everything. You definitely don’t want somewhere too busy or overcrowded so it’s worth considering the best time of day (and even the best time of year) to avoid the crowds. The likes of Cherry Blossom season (late March/early April) for instance, while undoubtedly beautiful and very romantic, is also the single busiest time of year with millions of extra visitors to Japan. The first few days of New Year’s Day are also very busy as Japanese people visit temples and shrines across the country. Golden Week – Japan’s week of national holidays – is another time when the country may seem busier than usual as many residents will be off work. And of course, in 2020, there’s also the small matter of the Olympics too – although if you and your partner are sports fans then maybe this would be the perfect time to propose?!

hidden gems, and cultural experiences in Japan, focusing on kendo, tea ceremonies, Zen meditation, and Nara's deer, I will organize the information as follows:\n\n### 1. Kendo Historical Sites and Experiences\n\n#### Key Locations:\n- **Musashi no Sato**: A historical site related to kendo, detailed on [Kenshi247](https://kenshi247.net/blog/2011/06/20/kendo-places-11-musashi-no-sato/).\n- **Tsuruga-jo Castle, Fukushima**: Offers kendo experiences, as described on [Japan Travel](https://www.japan.travel/en/sg/jbyj-blog/fukushima-kendo-experience-at-tsuruga-jo-castle/).\n- **Kyoto Kendo Experience**: Reviewed on [TripAdvisor](https://www.tripadvisor.in/Attraction_Review-g298564-d12146328-Reviews-Experience_KENDO_in_KYOTO-Kyoto_Kyoto_Prefecture_Kinki.html).\n\n#### Details:\n- **Prices and Schedules**: Typically, kendo experiences can range from ¥3,000 to ¥10,000 depending on the location and duration. It's advisable to check specific websites or contact the venues for up-to-date schedules and booking options.\n\n### 2. Tea Ceremony Experiences\n\n#### Key Locations:\n- **Tokyo Tea Ceremonies**: Information available on [Maikoya](https://mai-ko.com/culture/tea-ceremony/tokyo.html) and [ByFood](https://www.byfood.com/blog/tea-ceremony-tokyo-p-523).\n- **Kyoto Tea Ceremonies**: Detailed on [Tea Kyoto](https://tea-kyoto.com/).\n\n#### Details:\n- **Prices and Options**: Tea ceremonies in Tokyo and Kyoto typically cost between ¥2,000 to ¥5,000. Some experiences include kimono wearing, which may increase the price. Booking in advance is recommended, especially for popular spots.\n\n### 3. Zen Meditation Experiences\n\n#### Key Locations:\n- **General Guide**: [Japan Travel](https://www.japan.travel/en/guide/meditation/) provides a comprehensive guide to meditation experiences.\n- **Tokyo Zen Meditation**: Available at [Toki Tokyo](https://www.toki.tokyo/experience/zen-meditation).\n- **Zazen Meditation**: Offered by [Wabunka Enterprise](https://wabunka-enterprise.com/en/experiences/zazen-meditation).\n\n#### Details:\n- **Prices and Schedules**: Zen meditation sessions can range from ¥1,000 to ¥3,000. Sessions are often held in the mornings or late afternoons. It's best to check individual websites for specific times and to make reservations.\n\n### 4. Nara's Deer and Attractions\n\n#### Key Locations:\n- **Nara Park**: Detailed information can be found on [Visit Nara](https://www.visitnara.jp/destinations/area/nara-park/) and [Japan Guide](https://www.japan-guide.com/e/e4103.html).\n\n#### Details:\n- **Activities and Tips**: Nara Park is famous for its free-roaming deer. Visitors can purchase special deer crackers for feeding. The park is open year-round, and entry is free. It's advisable to visit early in the day to avoid crowds.\n\n### Conclusion\n\nFor a well-rounded cultural experience in Japan, consider combining these activities. For instance, a day could start with a Zen meditation session, followed by a tea ceremony, and end with a kendo experience. When visiting Nara, allocate a full day to explore the park and nearby attractions. Always check for the latest information on prices and availability, and consider booking experiences in advance to secure your spot.\n\n",

Where to propose in Japan\nIntro\n\nForget Paris, Japan is the new capital of romance. This achingly beautiful country is the perfect place to pop the question and is infinitely more original than more traditional proposal destinations. Japan is alternative, hip, and will look sensational in photographs when you share your happy news with family and friends. You could even return for the wedding and honeymoon! With Valentine’s Day just around the corner, let’s take a look at the most romantic locations in Japan to ask that question and get the answer you’re looking for you.

Similarly, if you’re getting down on one knee in a very popular public place, timing is everything. You definitely don’t want somewhere too busy or overcrowded so it’s worth considering the best time of day (and even the best time of year) to avoid the crowds. The likes of Cherry Blossom season (late March/early April) for instance, while undoubtedly beautiful and very romantic, is also the single busiest time of year with millions of extra visitors to Japan. The first few days of New Year’s Day are also very busy as Japanese people visit temples and shrines across the country. Golden Week – Japan’s week of national holidays – is another time when the country may seem busier than usual as many residents will be off work. And of course, in 2020, there’s also the small matter of the Olympics too – although if you and your partner are sports fans then maybe this would be the perfect time to propose?!
